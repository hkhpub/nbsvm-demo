i think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to
the location of the person you're taking action against .   it seems to
me the time and money involved in travelling out there  ( unless this
person is close to you )  wouldn't be worth it for a small claim . 
it really depends on how much money you're out . 

if i am wrong about any of this ,  someone please correct me !   ;  )

	good point ,  but i was just thinking .  .  i wanted to sell my hp28sx
calculator here in this newsgroup .  .  .  it is called a calculator ,  but really
it is a computer ,  albeit a small one ,  but it does function as one .  .  .  how
come car adds are acceptable ?  they cant run without computers nowadays .  .  .  . 
where does one draw the line ?  accept it ,  live with it ,  and if you care to , 
avoid it .  .  .  .

hi ,  everyone ; 


i need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster . 

several weeks ago i posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external hd for mac .  the scumster - r . e . p .  - called my friend and
they agreed on a price .  my friend  ( unexperienced and not too fluent in
english )  paid by check ,  requesting r . e . p .  to call him back when the check
arrives and the hd is send .  well ,  the check was cashed 3/24 and that is
that .  phone # that r . e . p .  gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left ;  e-mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer .  i know ,  that r . e . p .  is a student at
university of delaware ;  i have his e-mail address ,  his us postal address
and his  (  ?  )  phone# .  the question is :  what is the best way to proceed ? 

thanks in advance for any advice . 

sincerely , 
victor levenson  ( vvl2h@virginia . edu ) 

p . s .  the reason i did not put r . e . p . 's full name is that i still hope .  .  . 


p . p . s .  if i get enough responses i will post a summary ,  maybe even on a
regular basis .

mind my asking why you're selling a used machine with a damaged
keyboard for the about the same price as a brand new a4000/030
 ( a4000-ec030/4 megs/120meg ide hd/hd floppy/v3 . 0 os - $1899 )  ? 

i'd like to get an a3000 locally for something reasonable like less
than 1k without monitor .   brand new the a3000-25mhz/50 meg hd/hd
floppy/2 . 1 rom isn't running for more than $1400 or so . 

considering it's damaged ,  probabably has a real old version of the os
i'll offer $700 .   don't laugh .  .  . my a2000 isn't worth more than
$250-$300 these days .

according to reports ,  if you don't have dos yet ,  and don't have any
utilities  ( qemm ,  stacker ,  pctools ,  norton ,   .  .  .  )  then dos6 may be worth it .  

for people who have dos5 ,  and some sort of utility ,  dos6 doesn't offer
much .  you'd never know it from the usual hype that marketing is able

just to inform the readers of newsrc sony has just introduced a new datman , 
the tcd-d7 which is smaller and less expensive than the d3 .   also ,  the d7
has a coaxial jack which the d3 lacks .   oh ,  the d3 has always been
available through mail-order houses for less than $700 dollars new .  .  .  with
the new model coming out ,  i suspect the now obsolete d3 will be selling for 
even less .

4 channels of stereo input and 1 channel of stereo output ,  but i would
prefer 8 or more input channels .   each channel needs to have at least a 
volume control .   i'll consider buying broken equipment .   the mixer needs 
to be fairly small  ( i haven't got a lot of space for it )  .

i'll third the opinion about this outfit/franchise .  now ,  when i
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs ,  i'll specify that i
only pick up the normal ups charges  ( as if delivered directly to
ups )  ,  as i've been burned by $10 shipping charges for a $2 . 49 pkg . 
i will never use a mailing service unless i don't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever immediately .  i'll also
tell the person ,  if they agreed to pick up shipping ,  what is going on . 

other things to watch out for/consider : 

	the rates are $5 to $30 higher than ups direct . 

	for a non-ups  ( truck )  package ,  they quoted a rate
	of $85 .  fed ex economy air was only $85 for the
	same weight !  rps  ( a trucking package company ,  in many
	cities )  only wanted $18 .  guess who got it .  the mailbox
	operator told me i was not telling the truth about
	competitors' rates ,  said rps was unreliable  ( i've used them
	before with no problems )  ,  etc .  right . 

	a cod check goes to the mailing service .  our local
	mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
	remade check .  all this for an additional $3 . 00 over the
	ups cod charge .  what a deal .  .  .  .   : - ) 

	for packages over $100 ,  they charge you about double over
	what ups charges them for insurance .  i've never had
	a claim ,  but other netters  ( is ralph seguin out there ?  ) 
	have told horror stories about them .  .  . 

	all package traces have to be done through mailbox by
	mailbox . 

	our local mailbox operator told me i was lying when i
	asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
	to direct ups .  does he ever check ?  probably not .  .  . 

	their ups ground rates come close to fed ex's economy
	air rate ,  and fed ex will pick up ! 

	ups will pick up for a $5 charge in most areas !

 dit is geen fantastische advertentie over nep-rolexen

 aangezien het alleen al aanbieden van deze horloges onder
 vermelding van de echte merknaam niet geheel correct is , 
 wil ik met dit bericht duidelijk maken dat ik ,  marcel engelbertink , 
 niet meer zal adverteren met imitatie-horloges van het merk rolex . 

 enig persoon die hierin geiinteresseerd is kan ik jammer genoeg ook niet

 in spite of earlier mailing about fake-rolex's ,  i announce that i

subject :  humminbird depth sounder forsale


hi , 

	i have a humminbird hdr200 depth sounder for sale .  it
has been used for 1 season on my sailboat .  
	
	all parts are included as well as the installation
instructions .  it is even packed in the original box it came in .  there
is no damage to the unit or the transducer .  in fact ,  the transducer
was mounted *inside* the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull . 
so it led a  " sheltered "  life .  the transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as i did ,  or on the transom .  it cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull . 

	it is fully waterproof and fits into a 2 "  hole in a bulkhead
 ( that's where i had it installed )  or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat .  it reads depth to 199' and has a backlit lcd display .  it has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in .  

	i am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the nmea 0183 information .  this little depth sounder works fine
and is very stable . 


	it is usually priced as low as 130$ in some catalogs ,  i paid 150$ . 


	the first 80$ takes it ,  or best offer .

he is probably referring to the dos version .  .  the dos versions is up

so it is only up to like version 2 or something .

do not pay $40 for floppy drives .  .  they are about $40 new . 
also ,  you do not need documentation for floppies .  installation
for these things are idiot proof .  
just some advice .  .

i installed dos 6 last week ,  and had nothing but trouble afterwards . 
windows apps are hitting protection faults more than a kid can do 
to a pinata ,  and it does not seem to like to work with ndos  ( norton 
dos 7 . 0 )  .   other probs include : 

set pcplus=d : \pcplus for procomm plus no longer works . 
many of the little utilities to written for dos no longer works
	either .   ( mostly shareware ) 

i now have uninstalled dos 6  ,  and dos 5 works just fine . 
are there any apps that dos 6 will be able to run that dos 5 wont ?

	it's an experiment ,  place a not so subliminal ,  slightly
cagey message in front of a viewer and see how long it takes to create a response ,  and what was the response .  .  . 
	it was the same thing with the  " blow me "  message ,  only it had a
quicker response time .  .  . and some unexpected responses along with the
expectedly negative ones .  .  . 
	anyone see how long that took ?

for sale  .  .  .  : 
 
        hewlett packard deskjet 500 inkjet printer . 
 
        o perfect condition both internally and externally
        o comes with two full ink cartridges
        o less than six months old
        o comes with all original packaging ,  manuals ,  cables
          and software
 
        this is truly an excellent printer and is the low-cost
        alternative to a laser printer .   it prints with the
        quality of a laser printer ,  but for a fraction of both
        the inital cost and he long term cost  ( that is , 
        replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement
        of toner )  .   the printer prints at a maximum of 300*300
         ( d ) ots  ( p ) er  ( i ) nch  ( d . p . i .  )  on many different types
        and sizes of paper ,  including envelopes and
        transperencies .   printer prints in both landscape and
        portrait modes .   printer can accept up to two
        cartridges giving it things like more memory or
        additional fonts .   printer works excellently with
        windows and dos and brings truetype to its full
        potential . 
 
        i originally purchased the printer for $375 . 00 .   make me
        an offer ,  but i would prefer to stay in the $300 . 00
        range .   i will pay the shipping to anywhere in the

        p . s .  the printer will work with any computer that
             can accept a standard parallel or serial
             connection .    ( that is ,  ibm ,  amiga ,  etc .  )

subject :  >>for sale :  waxworks

********************[ pc game for sale ]******************

waxworks by horrorsoft/accolade  ( 5 . 25 "  ) 		   $30

by the same folks who brought you elvira i & ii .   i played
elvira i & ii ,  and think that horrorsoft has finally made
a very playable game with waxworks .   the look and feel is
roughly the same as in the elvira games ,  though the real time
fighting is a little easier to survive .   the first two games , 
especially elvira ii :  jaws of cerberus made it very tough to
stay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult .   this 
is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park ,  but it is
quite fair ,  in that there is always some weapon to be found
that is quite effective ,  or hint given as to the proper fighting
strategy .   in one of the four wax works to be explored ,  there is 
no fighting at all  ( well almost none )  ,  though all four contain
moderately challanging puzzles . 

the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really 
broken up into four seperate rpgs ,  one for each of the four exhibits
you must enter .   in starting each one ,  your character is transported
with no objects to use ,  and experience level 1 .   one exhibits traps
you inside a multi-level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must 
escape by fighting ,  mapping and puzzle solving .   another exhibit
traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
and pods ,  while the local humans have been transformed into plant
zombies .   this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
some humans ,  kill the head plant alien ,  and figuere out how to kill
the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up .   this is
perhaps the most horrifying exhibit .   another exhibit puts you into
jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper
victim ,  and of course the police think you are responsible .   you must
avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and 
meet him face to face - but first get a disquise .   the last exhibit
pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to 
stop the almost indestructible zombies .   

over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a 
creepy tone for the game ,  as was the case for the elvira games ,  though
gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game . 
i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans .

oh ,  dear .   let me be the first on my block . 

you have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the usenet groups :

i don't know whether this is an official usenet rule or just a long-

i don't want him nuked ,  i want him to be honest .   the junk mail has
been much more interesting than the promised catalog .   if i'd known
what i was going to get ,  i wouldn't have hesitated .   i wouldn't be
surprised if there were other folks who looked at the ad and said
 " nope "  but who would be very interested in the junk mail that results . 
similarly ,  there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who
aren't happy with the junk they got instead . 

the folks buying the mailing lists would prefer an honest ad ,  and
so would the people reading it .

hello neo-geo owners  ( and non-owners who couldn't resist the title ;  )  )  , 

i was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games .   i
mean ,  buying them from the stores can get kinda expensive .   $184 . 99 is
a little too much to be spending on each game .   but ahh ,  the quality .  .  . 
now i can get them for about $100 ,  but that's still a lot .

as a stand-alone meter or panel mounted .  brass fitting  ( looks
like standard 3/8 "  )  on back .  operates from 110 vac . 

i'd like $50 for it ,  or make an offer .  it is a lot more useful to
a lab than as an ersatz barometer ,  which is what i've been using
it for .

hello , 
  i am looking for the coleco tablehockey games that were popular
in the 70's .   the games that i seek have straight slots for the
defenseman ,  not the s shaped slots .   the players are attatched to
rods operated with springs .   if you have a game ( or games )  that
you would be willing to part with ,  please send me an e-mail
message at u34815@uicvm . uic . edu .   price is negotiable and
i would also cover shipping if you are out of state .   i am
part of a league that plays on a regular basis ,  the cthl  ( the
chicago table hockey league )  ,  and need a game to practice on . 
also ,  the league itself is always interested in purchasing
games to expand itself . 
                                  thank you ,

208k miles  ( yet much better condition than most cars w/100k ) 
meticulously maintained :  all records ,  3k mi oil changes
faded paint on top ,  otherwise excellent exterior and interior . 

the car has required no major repair work in the more than ten years i have
owned it .  it has never failed to start or broken down ,  even in the coldest
weather .  this has been an extraordinarily reliable and economical car ,  and
shows every sign of staying that way .  yet it is an absolute thrill to drive
when you take it to secluded twisty mountain road !  i sell it now , 
reluctantly ,  since i just succumbed to the convertible craving and bought a
new miata .

my girlfriend switched to gas-permeable hard lenses and no longer
needs a one year old soft contact lens cleaning unit .   it's one of
those where you pop in the lens case filled with solution and the
lenses ,  press the lighted timer button and let it cook .   no stains
 ( of course -- if you've owned one of these ,  you understand )  ,  maybe
a little dust on the cover .

my company maintains a 20 , 000+ mailing list which is regularly rented for
one time use by the major software companies .   the method you are using to
 " seed "  your junk mail ,  isn't really effective .   bulk mailers regulary 
either send their databases to be  " cleaned "  by the ncoa ,  which if you've
moved recently ,  will revert back to the original  " xxx cool "  ,  and in large
mailings ,  there will likely be a dupe of you ,  and they'll pick the first ,  and use the
others for future mailings . 
 
btw ,  our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of
a ms windows utility product in the $100 range ,  and is available through
direct media in ct .  ,  at $0 . 10 per name .   please let your direct mail
marketing rep .  know about this .  .   thanks .

for sale :   precision drafting machine ,  bruning ogp-0180 .   solid
older model with spring-loaded counter balance ;  clamps on table .   without
scales .   for right handed person .   $60/make offer ,  includes ups/parcel post 
postage . 

i'm guessing that it's from the 1940s or 1950s ,  a period well known for 
excellent drafting machine construction !   : - ) 
it's built with real metal parts ,  not cheap modern plastic ,  and it's painted 
the typical office grey popular in that period .   it's smooth working ,  and 
each of the two  " arms "  on it measures roughly 24 "  .   it has a dual clamp to 
enable you to clamp it on the edge or corner of a table .

all comics are in near mint to mint condition ,  are bagged in shiny 
polypropylene bags ,  and backed with white acid free boards .   shipping is

a large enough amount of stuff .   i am willing to haggle .

you've been looking for ,  and maybe i can help .   some titles i have posted
here don't list every issue i have of that title ,  i tried to save space .

subject :  top of the line jvc portable disc player for sale

i have used jvc's top of the line portable cd player for three months now . 
i have mostly used it in my car on long trips ,  so it has less than 20 hours of use on it .   the unit is one of the best that i have seen and listened to ,  but
i am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car . 

features include : 
	17 hz - 20 , 000 hz
	rechargeable nicad batteries
	wireless remote control
	ac adaptor
	headphones
	carrying belt and case
	digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
		25 presets ,  5 user programmable
	rca connections and cord
	jvc compulink capability  ( cord included ) 
	programmable from remote
	intro ,  random ,  repeat playback

i will include a discwasher  ( tm )  power converter to convert an automobile's
12v dc to the 5 . 5v dc that the unit requires .   i had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits ,   ( jvc makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at radio shack etc )  . 

i paid $235 for the disc player and another $30 for the power converter . 
i will sell the disc player alone for $180 ,  or both items for $190 .

i hope you realize that for a cellular phone ,  you need to subscribe to a
cellular carrier ,  and it usually takes at least one working day before
the service is available to you .  only then you can find out whether 
the phone is working .

subject :  intel fax modem for sale

i have an intel satisfaxtion modem/100 internal for sale . 
it runs at 2400 baud data mode and up to 9600 baud as a class 1 fax modem . 
it transmits up to 9600 baud  ( v . 29 )  and receives up to 4800 baud  ( v . 27 ter .  ) 

the modem has all original manuals and comes with software ,  icluding
  intel's satisfaxtion and faxability ,  as well as crosstalk communicator

i have used this modem less than an hour .   it came with my computer and i
  already had another one . 

i would like to ask $50 for this modem ,  but will entertain all serious offers . 

please email to jmu@acpub . duke . edu

thanks .

subject :  486sx motherboard/case/mouse

hello ,  i have a motherboard and a case for sale as a package . 
both of them came from a compuadd computer i bought last august and am 
  presently upgrading . 
here are the specs--

motherboard
-----------
cyrix 486sl 25 mhz microprocessor
chips and technology chipset  ( scatsx v2 . 3 . 6 slslc ) 
8 simm banks for a maximum of 32 megs of ram
built-in floppy and hard drive controllers
built-in ports--1 parallel ,  2 serial  ( 9 and 25 pin ) 
built-in paradise svga controller with 1 meg of ram  ( windows drivers inc .  ) 
   -can do up to 1024x768 @ 256 colors
   -based on the western digital wd90c31 chip
math co-processor slot
3 16-bit expansion slots and 2 8-bit expansion slots

case
----
low-profile desktop
very nice grey color
150 watt power supply
room for 2 floppies plus hd

mouse
-----
3-button
microsoft-compatible
grey color matches case

all original manuals and documentation ,  video drivers ,  etc .  are included . 

you are probably wondering why i must sell the case with the motherboard . 
it is simply because the case is custom-made for this particular board and
  you would be hard-pressed to fit another mb in it .   however ,  the case and
  this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly . 

as you can see ,  since this board includes drive controllers and a video 
  controller ,  you can save some money by buying this unit and not a mb
  where you would need to get io cards ,  video card ,  and drive controllers
  its just a lot more convenient on the whole

i would like to ask about $500 for this whole package .   i think this is a fair
  price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers/io
  ports .   all you need to do is add drives ,  a monitor ,  ram ,  and a keyboard .  
  also keep in mind that it isn't a generic board ,  but from compuadd . 
i also will entertain all serious offers . 

please email at jmu@acpub . duke . edu

thanks

subject :  final public dragon magazine update  ( last chance for public bids ) 

this is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction .   if there
are no new bids then the current bids stand  ( like that's gonna  happen .    :  )   )  . 
after this ,  any updates will be by e-mail *only* .   the entire auction 
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in .   so if you want to get in
on  this ,  be sure to bid now .   all bids must be made in *at least*
25 cent increments .   buyer will pay shipping .    ( unless you have any
particular fancy ,  it will be us mail 4th class special ,  with lots of
padding )  .   
all dragons are bagged .   the condition of them vary quite a bit ,  
so i've come up with my own condition system .   some dragons may be missing 
items like the inserts .   if you have any questions ,  feel free to ask . 
*
condition ratings - usually this is just an evaluation of the cover ,  as
most of the material inside is in great shape . 
excellent - ie- " as you find them in the store " 
very good - still in great condition ,  but can tell it's been boughten
good      - on down the line
very fair/fair - indicates lots of use  ( but still  " decent "  ) 
poor      -  indicates the material inside may be damaged  ( usually by
scissors )  .   
a * by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is 
missing  ( usually the insert ) 
i'll post another public update sometime this weekend  ( which will be the
final public posting ,  after which the auction will be by e-mail until
the bidding stops ) 
*
again if you have any questions ,  ask away .

subject :  panasonic dot matrix printer :  $165 complete


i would like to sell my dot matrix printer so i can upgrade to inkjet . 
it is a  " panasonic kx-p1124 24 pin multi-mode printer "  .   here are the
stats  ( from memory and the manual )  : 

-  360x360 dot-printing for hi-res graphics ,  etc . 
-  very fast  ( up to 192 cps )  printing in  " printer-controlled "   ( as
	opposed to windows driver-controlled )  printing
-  bidirectional printing for faster processing speed
-  5 fonts  (  " courier "  ,  " prestige "  ,  " bold ps "  ,  " script "  ,  " sans serif "  ) 
-  epson lq-2500 and ibm proprinter x24 printer emulation
-  can accept single sheets ,  envelopes ,  and 3 non-carbon copies by
	friction feed
-  front or bottom paper feed
-  6kb buffer

i will send a sample document and a printed gif/jpeg file to anyone
who wishes to send a sase .   with purchase  ( prepaid ,  please !  )  ,  i will
include the following accessories : 

-  manual
-  cable  ( centronics ) 
-  remaining stack of tractor-fed paper  ( about  . 4 "  ) 
-  free copy of windows printer driver  ( unless this is illegal ,  or if
	it is included with windows ) 
-  free unregistered dos shareware program  ( $2 registration ,  i think ) 
	that apparently offers some word processing capabilities
	from dos

the last two will be on a disk  ( either size )  .   i am asking for around
$165 ,  but i am open to any  ( reasonable )  offers .   i am a college
student ,  so i cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a
considerable portion of the money from this printer .   this price
includes all above items ,  and shipping  ( probably ups )  is included as
well .   i have the original box ,  but only one of the original styrofoam
end pieces .   i will use a towel on the other end  ( you get a free towel
too !  !  )  .   worked fine getting it here .   the whole shebang might not fit
in the original box ;  i will figure this out after the offers come in . 
email any questions and offers . 		-jon .

	considering that you can get a brand new sounds blaster
 ( original )  for around $80 i think this price is way too high .   then
again ,  things are worth what someone is will to pay for them .  .  .  .

i have a copy of this catalog in front of me as i write this . 
it does have tons of qool stuff in it .  
my impression is that they try not to send it out to  " browsers "  .  it
appears that if your not a buyer or an engineer they do not want to
waste a catalog on you .  when you get a catalog there's a  " vip code "  you
have to give them  " to ensure your continued subscription .  "  . 
anyway ,  if you want to get in touch with them ,  the company is

550 division street
campbell ,  ca 95008
 ( 408 )  378-8400 
 ( they also have fax #'s and toll free #'s for ordering and tech support ) 

please note that i am not associated with them in any way .  in fact ,  i
have never ordered from them so i can't comment on their products or
service but the catalog is real and i am sitting here salivating over
it .

well ,  i've been informed that the price on the whole thing i'm selling is now
less than the price i'm selling it for .   that will teach me to wait that long

it is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products . 

in addition to improper etiquette ,  this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail .   

am i correct in assuming this is improper ,  and if so ,  what can be 
done to penalize such an improper use ?

i'd offer $150 for your scanner ,  shipping at your expense ,  payment to
be sent by personal check within 24 hours after receipt of goods -- or if
you live nearby and can deliver ,  payment in cash with 24 hour advance notice
so i can go to the bank .   if sent by mail ,  i reserve the right to return
it at my expense if when i check it out i find it to be defective in some
way . 

btw ,  why would you sell such a fine scanner ?   did you replace it with
some other instrument or find it not to be satisfactory in some way ?

	as a matter of fact d . j .  ,  it does make a difference . 
	almost a half million new users joined the internet last year , 
	many of them are commercial businesses .  the ban on commercial
	use of internet is no more . 

	one should have the breeding not to post commercial material
	on an account provided by ones employer or school ,  unless the
	provider of such account gives permission .   ( ha !  ) 

	those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only
	by our innate good taste and no have no  " administrator "  to 
	guide (  ?  )  us .

they sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked 
me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
award .  they mislabled my address and i did not receive my package
until one month ago .  i was mad and angry about how it took them
so long to get my package .  so i wrote them a letter and requested
for a refund .  they never return my letter .  i was lucky enough to
find out their telephone number through operator and received the
package .  i immediately returned the package and wrote them another
letter to ask for refund .  the package was returned because they
address they put on the package was incorrect .  i attempted to 
call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number . 
it took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number , 
but they refused to take any responsibility .  i spoke to their
manager and she said she would call me back ,  but she has not call
yet .  but i was able to get their address from their front desk . 
should i just go ahead and send the package ?  or should i waite until
they call me back ? 

i know there are several people on the net has experience with the
same company .  i would like to know how they got their money back . 
if you have similar experience ,  please advise me . 

thanks in advance ,

subject :  apology  ( printing ) 

dear fellow usenet users : 

	i would like to give a formal apology for posting an advertisement 
about my printing business .   i did not intend this to be an advertisement ,  
but rather an offer for people on the usenet ,  many of whom use printing
on a regular basis .   i was not aware that this is not  " legal "  on the usenet . 
i am only trying to put myself through college .   for those of you who
requested information ,  i will write to you privately .   for those of you who 
are having fun flooding my mailbox ,  i think you can grow up .   to offer advice
is one thing ,  but to use profanity toward me is another . 

thank you ,

subject :  jfk autograph for sale  ( serious inquiries only ) 


   after hearing about the mcgovern house story on paul harvey i never had any
idea how much it was worth .   the autograph is on a senate pass card
and is signed 'john kennedy . '  i don't remember if it was signed 
'senator john kennedy' or whether or not it was dated ,  because i haven't
looked at it in quite a while .   currently it is in a safety deposit box . 
i would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction
house such as christy's since that would tend to take away from the profit .  
if you  ( or any collector you may know )  has an interest in this please send
me an e-mail expressing your interest .   i will see what i can do to make 
a scanned gif of it available to prospective buyers .

from :  davisonj@en . ecn . purdue . edu  ( john m davison ) 
subject :  tcd-d3 dat walkman for sale

        i recently backed out of purchasing an almost-unused sony tcd-d3 dat
walkman ,  having found someone else who has a unit i personally prefer  ( and am
paying more for )  .   however ,  it's still a heck of a machine for the price -- it
is quite rugged ,  and many people out there swear by it .    ( it's probably the
most popular walkman-style dat machine out there .  ) 

        anyway ,  the guy selling it is bryan davis  ( bdavis@netcom . com )  ,  and
here's what he told me : 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
here is what is included : 
        - tcd-d3 datman . 
        -  ( 2 )  rca to stereo 1/8 "  plug cables .   one for analog input ,  one for
          analog output . 
        - optical digital i/o cable  ( one lead for input ,  one for output )  . 
        - a copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase .   the
          unit is still under factory warrantee . 
        - ac adaptor/battery charger . 
        - rechargable battery . 

i paid $750 + tax for it so i hope you don't mind if i keep the 60 minute
tape it came with  ( i have some samples on it !  )  . 

[by the way ,  he spent at least $100 too much for it ,  unless he's including an
 extended warranty ,  which is advised for dat machines ,  since it costs about
 $300 to replace the head when it wears out ,  and it probably will within 5
 years if you use it a lot .  .  -- davisonj]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        i'm not going to quote my sale price for him :  that would not be nice . 
send him mail and ask him what he wants . 

        again ,  i've used the tcd-d3 ,  and i have to say that i can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is .   i've been using one for a little
while ,  and although i had some problems with it recently ,  i should also point
out that the particular one i was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been _used_ during that time .    ( this is the same exact dat machine
that was lugged around the u . s .  and canada to record the jazz butcher
conspiracy for their recent live album .  ) 

        bryan davis says : 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
i know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in s . f who use that model  ( and have been for a while )  with no reported
problem .   my problem is that everyone i know already has one . 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        'nuff said . 

        the reason i'm not getting it is that i found someone else selling me a
unit that features phono-plug spdif i/o instead of optical  ( i don't have any
optical ports on my equipment ,  but you ,  the reader ,  might )  ,  and it also has
some other bells & whistles that the tcd-d3 doesn't .    ( i am also paying more
for the alternative .  )   note that phono-plug-to-optical spdif adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one . 

        of course ,  it has scms .   all consumer decks do .    ( so do sony minidiscs , 
by the way .  ) 

        anyway ,  if you're interested ,  get in touch with bdavis@netcom . com .

subject :  bare 4mb 386/25 micronics system - $450/$350 <reduced ! >

 " bare "  = case ,  a power supply ,  and a motherboard  ( with ram and a coprocessor )  . 
everything else is yours to add as you like . 

the motherboard : 
    - us-made micronics 8-slot motherboard with intel 386dx/25mhz cpu
    - 64kb sram cache
    - 4mb 80us ram using 4x1mb simms  ( worth $120 alone ) 
    - cyrix 83d87 math coprocessor  ( worth $90 alone ) 
    - norton si 6 . 0 rating of 26 . 1
    - latest version phoenix bios

the case/power supply : 
     - standard desktop case .  230watt power supply with the usual connectors . 
     - room for five floppy/hard drives  ( three visible ,  two internal )  . 

*new* micronics cpus often command a several-hundred dollar premium
over clone motherboards because they are us-made ,  use high-quality
components ,  and are known to be both very reliable and compatible .  they
have been oemed in systems sold by both gateway and zeos at various
points in the past .   ( check out the ads in the back pages of byte or pc
magazine if you want to see this price differential for yourself .  ) 

price :  $450 complete ,  $100 less if you don't want/need the case and
power supply .  the board is fully guaranteed .  email for further details
or for any questions . 

thanks !

   both space ace and dragon's lair ii  ( $750 ) 
-----------------------------------------------
 
   these games require a sony 1450 laserdisc player .   the
nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
normal laserdisc movies on it as well .   i have one which i
will sell for $600 by itself ,  $550 with a purchase of one
complete system or $500 if you buy both systems . 
 
    i currently run this into my entertainment center .   i have
it housed in a pc computer case with with its own fan ,  and 
power supply .   i run the audio into my stereo system ,  and the
laserdisc runs directly into the t . v .  .   i have made a mount for
the joysticks and the buttons .   first person who buys both
games will get it all ,  otherwise you have to do it yourself . 
 
    if you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
arcade cabinet this can be done as well .   the graphics will
go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet . 
 
    everything works perfectly .   the laserdisc player has an
rs-232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
type applications .   the laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
place and have no scratches on them . 
 
    if you are interested please email me .

the only option you  " should "  jumper is the drive select ,  shown as  " 4c32c1 " 
above .   there is also a drive power-up option jumper  ( elsewhere on the
drive's board )  but the odds of that having been unset are slim . 

since the 3b1  " normally "  has only one hd ,  you would jumper betwwwn  " c1 "  to
select the first  ( possible )  drive address ;  if the 2190 is your second drive
on the 3b1 ,  then jumper between  " 2c "  .

items for sale .  .  .  .  . 

this package was bought throught a award give-away company .  i attempted
to cancel my order before i received the package ,  but i was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund .  i know the truth
which i would never get my $697 back ,  but i wish to get my money back as
close as possible .  here is the describtion of the package .  .  . 

nishika 3d camera	it takes very good picture ,  never been opended
			or used .  it came with wide angle flesh ,  carring
			case ,  film ,  and a instruction video .  it has four
			lens and created a 3d effect on a regular 35mm
			film . 

jewelry			it came with the package as additional gift . 

bahama vacation voucher	the voucher is good for two rt airfare to freeport . 
			the users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person
			per-night .  meals ,  ground transfer ,  hotel tax is
			_not_ included . 

las vegas ,  reno ,  orlando	the voucher provides one rt airfare ,  and
				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights . 
				meals ,  ground transfer ,  hotel tax is not
				included .  the voucher is good for all 3
				locations ,  but you can't travel to all 3
				places at once . 

cancun ,  mexico		the voucher provides one rt airfare ,  and hotel
			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights .  meals and
			ground transfer ,  hotel tax is not included as
			usual . 

i paid $697 for the whole package .  so try not to be cold-blooded when you
make your offer .  details would be provided by request .  i do wish to sell
the whole package at once .  so if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers ,  i don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
if you are interested in the camera ,  you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift . 

if you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards .  
trust me ,  you would get the exactly the same package as i did .  there is 
only one award which will be given away .  so don't bother even to call them 
back ,  if you are really interested ,  you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price .  and you could receive the package within a week  (  i waited three 
months to get my first and final packages )  .  also ,  they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company .  so why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price . 

if you are interested ,  please reply to me as soon as posible .  i really
wish to get this over with .  make me an offer ,  if i am confortable with
your offer ,  i would send the package by u . p . s .  the next day morning . 
more details could be given if you wish .

subject :  slide projectors trade for photo equipments

there are many people want to buy my kodak autofocus carousel projectors
but i don't have lenses or remote to sell .   they prefer to buy a projector
with all accessaries .   so i have to post another news asking for lenses
to fit those kodak slide projectors : 

i am willing to give away singer caramate ii or singer caramete sp  ( 
w/ built-in unremovable lens ,  built-in casette player ,  speaker ,  new 500 hr
bulb )  try to trade for kodak projector lenses . 

each projector  ( viewer )  will equal trade for 1 or 2 kodak projector lenses
depend on the focal length .   i will pay for the shipping for singer 
projector  ( viewer )  . 

since i don't need those singer projectors ,  if you have some 35mm slr system
you don't need ,  i am willing to do the trade as well .

subject :  24-pin printer for sale as well

   i have a 24-pin printer which is an alps allegro24 .   it's both a fast
printer with lq and a very sophisticated design .   it has a straight paper
path and the capability of auto-forwarding sheets to tear off and then back
 ( a big paper saver as you never have to waste sheets to get a current
print out )  .   it can also handle single sheets without removing the formfeed
and has sophisticated preferences options  ( you can interactively program
all the preferences to control the printer and get printed feedback without
ever using a computer )  .   you get prompts and menus to pick your current setup
and default set up .   this was the top of the line lq dot matrix when i bought
it three years ago for $399 .   it is also epson lq2500 compatible  ( besides it's
own modes )  and comes with ibm driver software  ( which i've never used since i
own an amiga )  .   has a card slot for upgrading memory or fonts . 

    i'll let it go for $150 including shipping prepaid .   cod orders must pay
all shipping and cod costs .

   also a light gun and uforce controller for nintendo but with pd driver
software to use them on the amiga .   the light gun is fully remote  ( no wires )  .

	however ,  thad ,  you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'pc' ,  not 'unix-pc' .   also note the strange cross-posting  ( as he
probably did not )  ,  so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on .   if it *is* a pc  ( or clone )  ,  then the  " 2c "  jumper would be
the correct choice . 

	i've left the cross-posting in effect ,  since i'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in .   : - )

  sorry for any confusion i may have created .   the disk did come out of
a vs2000 and i would like to use it in a ibm pc clone .   the reason that i
posted to comp . sys . 3b1 was because i saw the drive  ( xt2190 )  mentioned
in a for-slae notice .   i had asked for info before but didn't receive
any replies . 

  thanks once again for the help .

subject :  in case a deal is a lemon  .  .  .  . 


hi to all . 

since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer ,  i'd like to bring
this issue for discussion - what would be the best solution in case a deal 
became a lemon ? 

as i understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty , i am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item i received is out of order .  the seller insisted
that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that i paid if i send the item back to him and after he is sured it
is bad .  is this reasonable ? 

basically i would like to believe the seller tells the truth .  also ,  i am positively to say that i've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of 
the thing .  my assumption here is everyone is honest - so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars .

i'm sure that the motorola is worth it ,  but this kind of thing
has always mystified me .   $400 is the price of very good ,  new
dual-band ,  fully synthasized ht .   yes ,  yes ,  i know motorola
hts are bullet-proof ,  unbreakable ,  plutonium-based 
indestructable -- you can drive a tank over them and they'll
still work .   but just how often does that come up ?   why are hams
willing  ( and they *are* )  to spend the price of a synthaszied
dual-bander for a 2-channel xtal rig ?  ?  ?   note :  this is not
a flame ;  as i said ,  i'm sure this is a good deal for this rig . 
i'm just amazed that it *is* a good deal .   i would have guessed
that a 2 channel xtal rig could never be worth as much as a dual-
bander to a ham ,  no matter how durable .  just shows you how wrong
*i* can be .

i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable-front-panels
were to make the radio useless ,  and thus discourage theft  ( that is if the 
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left .  ) 

if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio 
originally costs ,  or even sold at all , 
then the above discouragement wouldn't be so great . 

i personally would be unhappy ,  if i bought a radio like that ,  thinking that 
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio's value ,  and the covers were
sold by the company  ( or other legitimate source )  cheaply .

subject :  photo  " stuff "  forsale


 
time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses ,  cameras and photo stuff
that's not being used .   some are gems ,  some are mundane . 
 
 
minolta af 50/1 . 7 lens for maxxum cameras .   new lens ,  but i guess it'd
be best to call it a  " demo "  since i did not get the literature ,  box or
warranty cards .   $30 . 
 
vivitar 2x converter for nikon f or ai lenses .   pretty cute  " flip back " 
tang so it will work with all manual focus nikon lenses - and bodies . 
it will even couple  ( and double )  a non-ai lens to an ai body .   $15 . 
 
pentax 50/1 . 4 screwmount lens .   well actually it's a super-takumar which
is what they all were back then .   very mint condition .   $25 .  nice hard
case for this lens $5 more .  . 
 
alpex 135/2 . 8 lens .   beautifully made ,  all metal construction with fine
optics .   minolta mount .   $25 .   another hard case that fits this with
strap can be added .  . call it $7 more . 
 
vivitar 283 flash .   the one that made vivitar famous  ( until the 285
eclipsed it )  .   tilt head ,  removable sensor ,  variable auto exposure . 
$30 . 
 
universal  " roamer 63 "  folding old  " bellows "  camera with leather case . 
uses 120 or 620 film ,  100mm f6 . 3 lens .   kinda cool articulated shutter
release .   decent shape .   $20 . 
 
weston 540 lightmeter .   nothin super fancy ,  but it works well ,  and is a
good cross check to built in meters .   $7 with case and strap . 
 
and finally .  . the  " gems " 
 
pentax auto 110 camera with 24mm f2 . 8 lens .   this is the little
 ( and i do mean tiny )  slr that pentax made .   has interchangeable lenses , 
but try and find the 20-40 zoom ,  true through the lens viewing with
split image focus ,  and completely auto exposure .   $70 . 
 
olympus 35rc rangefinder camera .   a really cute little camera with 42mm
lens  ( f2 . 8 )  with built in manual or auto exposure ,  self timer etc .   i
think this was the predecessor to the xa - and it's nearly all metal . 
i won't mind holding onto this one if it doesn't sell .   $60 . 
 
olympus om-1 with flash shoe ,  leatherette case ,  50/1 . 4 zuiko lens ,  and
tokina sd  ( super dispersion )  70-210 lens .   these are all in very nice to
mint condition ,  except for one little ding on the om body near the film
advance lever .   lenses are perfect ,  and the tokina is a very compact , 
and sharp lens .   $225 for the set . 
 
 
that'll do to clean out some of the stuff .   feel free to offer on this
stuff ,  although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in
shipping it .  . 
 
for more details call or email .

subject :  okidata printer for sale

fellow netters , 

i have an okidata printer i would like to sell .   a description follows : 

okidata 180 printer including cables for both ibm compatibles  ( centronics
parallel )  and commodore  ( rs-232 - round )  .   also includes power cable ,  manual , 
and a handful of computer paper to get you started .   this is a 9-pin printer .  
i recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon .   a print sample 
can be provided upon request .   this is a very dependable printer - it never
jams or does  " weird "  things .   i have used it with a commodore for about 3 years
and am now using it with my 486sx .   i use mainly wordperfect 5 . 1  ( see next
post )  for which i got a driver  ( at no charge )  that directly supports the 
okidata 180 in epson fx mode .  

when i got the printer ,  it was selling for around $200-220 new  ( i got mine
from tenex brand new - for a christmas present )  .   i would like to get about
$100 or so for it .   if you are interested at all in it ,  please give me a ring
 ( e-mail )  and make an offer .

subject :  not all deals are bad .  .  . 

fellow netters , 

i just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there  ( even outside of iowa )  .   i'm sorry if anyone thinks that i am wasting
space ,  but i thought you might want some relief from the  " so-and-so is a thief " 
posts .   not that i think we shouldn't hear about the bad deals ,  but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while . 

after seeing his post on one of the for sale groups ,  i mailed mr .  mark miller a
request for his copy of wordperfect 5 . 1 for dos .   he suggested a price of $50
in his ad ,  but when i phoned him ,  he quoted $40 plus shipping .   that sounded
more than fair to me ,  so i told him that i would send him a check the next day .  
imagine my surprise when i logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold  ( after i had just mailed
the money order )  .   after another e-mail message to him ,  he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake - i was the one who he was holding it for .   he
sent the package as soon as he got the money ,  along with a letter stating a
transfer of license .   this wasn't good enough for wordperfect ,  so i asked him
to fill out one of their forms .   no problem - we thought .   it took three times
to get it to the right address  ( my fault )  .   anyway ,  he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a workbook that i had no idea was included in the
deal .   again ,  he apologized for not sending it before .   i now have the world's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left .   i recoend that if you ever see that mark is selling anything thatat
you may want ,  give him a call .   if i had the choice ,  i would purchase all of my
software from him . 

bravo ,  mr .  miller !

the front covers should be available from sony .   check with a local car
stereo shop .   you will probably  ( definitely )  have to provide the units 
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card .   i 
don't know the cost ,  but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover ,  so it stands to reason that it can be replaced . 

as to deterring theft : 

when i worked for a stereo shop ,  we referred the customer to a sony 800
number .   we would not sell the face ,  nor did we have them available .   most
people who came in asking for the face cover  ( or a pullout sleave for that
matter )  would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they couldn't use .   if theft occurs with these decks ,  notify sony .   serial
numbers do catch theives . 

just a thought , 
michael

subject :  **nash metropolitan forsale ! **


my little nash has sat for about a year  ( had been running )  ,  but now i must move
a long distance and there are too many things to carry with me .   here are the
details of the car : 

1958 hardtop--exterior condition : 
     rocker panels rusted out at weld points ,  no rust at typical spots like
     door hinge mounting points ,  back battery box ,  etc .   missing front bumper , 
     front pan dented up ,  one weld popped in front .   this is for the most part
     a solid ,  restorable automobile . 

     interior condition : 
     missing original steering wheel ,  has one of the smaller aftermarket
     wheels ,  seats need reupholstered ,  general fair condition . 

     mechanical condition : 
     had been running ,  but now does not want to start .  .  . needs new rings  ( which
     i have )  also have extra parts such as complete long block ,  extra steering
     shaft ,  etc . 

for a car that has not been touched since 1958 ,  it is in solid shape .   it will
obviously need some work ,  but will make a good project . 

price :   well ,  this is a tough one ,  i would like to get around 800 . 00 ,  but will
consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it .  if you 
have things to trade such as tools ,  toys ,  cameras ,  comics ,  cards ,  etc .  ,  
anything easily movable to florida ,  i may consider that as well . 

hit <r> ,  or my e-mail address is ellis . 15@osu . edu

subject :  looking for a teacher in miami

sounds a little odd but i sold an amiga hand scanner to
an elementary school teacher in south florida  ( miami ,  i
think )  but i have just recently found that i still have
the scanner manual .   the original shipment included the
software manual ,  disks ,  packaging ,  etc . 

basically ,  i have since lost the name & address of the 
person i  sold it to .  .  . and i would like to get it to him . 

if that person sees this ,  please send me an email to : 

dlneal@cbda9 . apgea . army . mil

thanx ,  and sorry for taking up net space .

reminding us that advertising is not done on internet : 

	   as a matter of fact d . j .  ,  it does make a difference . 
	   almost a half million new users joined the internet last year , 
	   many of them are commercial businesses .  the ban on commercial
	   use of internet is no more . 

jack ,  there is a difference between using the network for commercial
purposes and advertising in newsgroups .   business communication is
okay .   advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet
who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay . 

	   those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only
	   by our innate good taste and no have no  " administrator "  to 
	   guide (  ?  )  us . 

i suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not
in anybody's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention
it didn't want .   you may belong to the public library ,  but that
doesn't mean you can deface the books ,  disorder the stacks ,  or disturb
the other patrons . 

you're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users  ( many
academic and military ,  who get irritable about a network for which
they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business
advertising )  follow .   there are secret masters here ,  just like
everywhere else .   they're not as obvious as the ones on prodigy ,  but
they're here . 

no doubt at some point the internet ,  like everything else ,  will become
grotty enough to carry advertising .   at that time i hope it is
confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups---like
misc . writing .

i'm both .   i've made some $4k worth of pc products purchasing
decisions for one company i'm affiliated with in the past 6 months
alone .    ( in a delicious bit of irony ,  an interesting fraction went to
suppliers that i suspect got my mailing address from these people .  ) 
more is in the pipeline right now . 

if they wanted to discuss these sorts of things ,  upfront is the
way to do it .

i have several vip codes .   here's the one i'm using for these sorts of
things :   " 6 "  .    ( if you want one ,  send me mail and i'll put you in touch

oh no !   someone is provided useful information and mentioned that they
made money in the field .   don't they know that usenet is reserved for
uninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff
 ( from houses to dead pcs )  at a huge markup/trying to unload stuff they
bought from their company at just under retail ,  and other
 " non-commercial "  activities .

the net is not  " supposed "  to be a dumping ground for free ads ,  but
reserving it for tripe doesn't seem to be a significant improvement . 

>in addition to improper etiquette ,  this product is a mailing list
>used for generating junk mail .   

so ?   either they target it well enough to pay for it ,  in other words , 
they manage to send it to people who want the stuff  ( in which case it
is junk only for the  " rest "  and the transaction costs are borne
appropriately in this case )  or they go bankrupt .   seems fair to me . 

>am i correct in assuming this is improper ,  and if so ,  what can be 
>done to penalize such an improper use ? 

you could hold your breath .   you could kill offending messages as
they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further , 
but not until you turn blue .

subject :  digital voice processor for sale


hi all

i have a korg dvp-1 for sale for $300 . 00 + shipping .   for those who've not
had the pleasure : 

it is a midi controlled  ( no keyboard of it's own )  rackmountable digital voice
processor .   what can it do with your voice ?   it can pitch-shift it  ( change the
notes you sing )  .   it can add harmonies to your singing  ( up to 5 parts at one
time )  .   it can change your voice into a synthesizer's voice but leave what
you say alone and intelligible .   this works well for a  " computerized "  sounding
singer ,  or robot voice .   for those of you who just thought about that ,  yes -
you can do the voices from robo-cop ,  and the old elo lead-ins with it ,  and yes -
i'm a little red-faced to say that i tried those specifically .   for an input , 
it takes both :  xlr  ( 3-prong mic )  and 1/4 "  cables .   for output ,  you can have
a combination of the original-input-only ,  and your choice of mix between the
original signal and the effect  ( can be effect only if desired )  .   it has preset
setups ,  which you can edit and save for your own preferences .   it has a couple
of light scratches ,  but does not look bad ,  and works flawlessly .   even when we
don't use it in my music ,  it's been good for after-hours fun in the studio . 
the manual is included .   i never got around to getting rack-ears for it ,  but
it has only gotten studio use from me - no roading ,  so it's not beaten .

asking for $500 or best offer .  .  . 

i paid $697 for the whole package .  and it is too late for me to get the

provided by request .  i do wish to sell the whole package at once .  so if

sell the camera to other for a higher price .  if you are interested in

bother even to call them back ,  if you are really interested ,  you could 
get it from me for a cheaper price .  and you could receive the package 
within a week  (  i waited three months to get my first and final packages )  .  
also ,  they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay 
for the interest to the credit card company .  so why spend more than you
should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price .

subject :  items 4sale ,  received from a award giving company
from :  koutd@hiramb . hiram . edu  ( douglas kou ) 

i participated in a promotion by a company called visual images . 
i attempted to cancel my order before the package arrived .  i was
not able to stop them and now i have a package which i do not need . 

nishika 3d camera ,  wide angle flesh ,  film ,  carring case ,  instruction
tapes ,  and some jewelrys . 

3 vacation vouchers to bahama ,  cancun ,  las vegas ,  orlando . 

i paid $697 for the promotion package ,  and the vacation vouchers
came as gift .  i really want to sell them ,  so make me an offer for
the whole package .  if you are participating in a award ,  $697 is how
much you would end up paying .  and i strongly believe that you would
get the same award as i do .  if you are interested in those items , 
you could get them from me for a cheaper price . 

let me know ,  and make me an offer .  no flames please ,  i have got enough . 

you could reach me at koutd@hirama . hiram . edu

subject :  sony amplifier and crossover for sale


for sale !  !  !  ! 

1 )  sony car stereo amplifier  ( model xm-2040 ) 
	rated power 20wx4 ,  into 4 ohms from 20-20 , 000hz @0 . 5%thd
	2 ohm stable
        short circuit and overload protected
 
this is a great little amplifier that i picked up as a demo model at lechmere
last spring ,  and never got a chance to install .  it's been tested ,  and it 
works great .  .  . a perfect amplifier for adding 4-speaker power to a system ,  or 
for powering mids or tweets .  .  . whatever .  mounted on a board ,  complete with a 
rs 15 amp noise filter ,  with all connections made to barrier strips for easy 
screw-type contacts .  lists new in crutchfield for $129 ,  am asking 
			$75 o . b . o complete


2 )  sony electronic crossover  ( model xec-500 ) 
	freq response 5-100 , 000 hz  ( +0 , -3 db ) 
	s/n ratio 105 db  ( a wtd .  ) 
	high pass x-over @flat , 80 , 120 , 180 hz  ( 12db/octave ) 
	low pas x-over @50 , 80 , 120 , 180 hz  ( 18db/octave ) 
	1/2 din size for in-dash installation in many cars ! 

this to , l is an exceptional unit which i found extremely useful  back in the 
days when i had a car to put a stereo in .  two sets of rca-type inputs  ( f/r )  ,  and three sets of outputs  ( f/r/sub )  each output with seperate level control .  
variable low boost control  ( +10 db@40 hz )  for extending low bass ,  and seperate high and low pass crossover points make this a great unit for anybody who's 
interested in building a sub/satellite type system 
	
	used with orig .  box&papers $130 o . b . o
	 

both units work flawlessly ,  and are in excellent shape cosmtically  ( ie no 
scratches ,  etc .  )  anyone who is interested ,  please respond to 
	
	coates@wpi . wpi . edu

i'll be happy to answer any questions you might have .  .  . oh yeah if you want both
i'll sell the amp with th x-over for $175 or so .  .  . thanks

subject :  spring cleaning sale ! 


time once again to clean out the ol' closet .   some stuff is up for offers ,  some
isn't .   please read carefully . 


in the make offer department : 

	wordperfect 5 . 0 ,  upgrade copy .   includes all disks and all upgrade
	manuals .   best offer . 

	balance of power ,  1992 edition ,  for the amiga .   with manual and reg . 
	card .   best offer . 


in the for sale department : 

	technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel stereo tape deck .   because
	it's auto-reverse ,  this deck records onto tape just like a cassette
	deck does ,  so it's not very good for splice-type editing .   however , 
	i have used it effectively in  " tape studio "  applications for mastering , 
	and it works great .   3 . 75 and 7 . 5 ips speeds ,  supports up to 7 "  reels . 
	dual lighted vu meters with record indicators .   full auto-reverse
	capable  ( and the mechanism works ,  too !  )  .   adjustable sound on sound , 
	and socket for remote control  ( i don't know where you'd find one ,  but
	they used to make 'em )  ,  plus a 110vac unswitched outlet .   this unit
	is in excellent condition and i have had it rebuilt once since i got
	it--works perfectly . 

	price :   $225 . 00 or best offer ,  or possible trade  ( see below )  . 


	panasonic kx-p1624 printer .   24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both
	text and graphics modes .   warranty cards ,  manuals ,  all the usual stuff
	you expect when buying like-new merchandise .   i'm selling it because i
	now have a better printer .   this is the wide carriage version of the
	kx-p1124 ,  by the way .   test prints are available upon request . 

	price :   $250 . 00 o . b . o .  or trade . 


	excalibur custom pool cue .   19 oz .  ,  13 mm ,  brass joint ,  irish linen
	wrap ,  could use a new tip but will hold up for a while .   i've got too
	many cues as it is ,  and don't need this one .   hits nicely ,  is very
	straight and in excellent condition . 

	price :   $125 . 00 o . b . o .  or trade .   imperial hard case  ( 1 butt/1 shaft ) 
	available for an additional $40 . 00 . 


trades :   i need the following things ,  and i have no cash of my own right now , 
so if you want to trade ,  it needs to be straight-across .    the list : 

	amiga rom upgrade to at least 2 . 04 ,  preferably 2 . 1+ ,  with appropriate
	dos and workbench . 

	1 meg agnus chip for the amiga . 

	amiga hard drive and controller  ( preferably scsi )  . 

	ibm-compatible hard drive  ( and controller if not mfm )  .   this one's 
	touchy ,  as i have a full-height and don't have room for more unless
	i swap out--needs to be above 100m ,  and i will consider trading a
	good st-4096 in the deal . 

	intel 9600ex or 14 . 4ex or similar external high-speed modem . 


this is not a complete list ,  but it's close .   if you've got something way off
the track of this list ,  it's probably not going to interest me at this point . 
email responses ,  please .

subject :  wysiwyg word processor for dos !  !  !  !  !  ! 

hey !  !  !  i've just upgraded my laptop to a windows-capable one ,  so i 
don't need my dos word processor anymore .   it's a great word 
processor .   easy-to-use ,  undemanding on the system ,  and
best of all ,  it has a wysiwyg editing mode .   this is something
word perfect doesn't have !  !   and all i'm asking is $65 + shipping . 
it even comes with several hundred dollars of free utilities !  !  ! 

$65 for a full-featured wysiwyg word processor !  !  !   perfect for
a laptop ,  or a lower powered machine ! 

check this out : 
ca> it has :  
ca> - wysiwyg-mode editing  ( word perfect still trying to do
ca> this !  )  
ca> - graphics-importing ,  scaling ,  and resizing  ( comes
ca> with free art !  )  
ca> - scalable fonts  ( 30 typefaces included !  ) 
ca> indentical from screen to printer !   ( see below for more info
ca> on font generator )  
ca> - on-line spell-checking and thesaurus
ca>  ( see below for more info !  )  
ca> - great 10-level outliner ! 
ca> - multiple columns
ca> - dual-document opening and editing
ca> - line and box drawing
ca> - search and replace
ca> - cut ,  copy ,  insert ,  and paste between documents and inside
ca> documents  
ca> - justification control
ca> - resettable margins ,  tabs ,  and line-spacing
ca> - savable layouts
ca> - headers ,  footers ,  page numbering
ca> - table of contents
ca> - multiple rulers in one document
ca> - mail merge
ca>  
ca> also included as free utilities : 
ca> - publisher's powerpak font engine :  this gives pfs : write
ca> scalable fonts  in sizes from 4pt to 72pt !   support for
ca> screen  ( in write )  and printer   ( even 9-pin dot-matrix looks
ca> great !  )  .   comes with 30 typefaces .   supports  subscripts and
ca> superscripts ,  too !  
ca> - grammatik iv :  the grammar and style
ca> checker .   comes with a quick  reference card for easy use . 
ca> it really helped my punctuation and usage !  
ca> - international correctspell english and roget's electronic 
ca> thesaurus :  th dictionary and thesuarus pack is published by 
ca> the publishers of the american hertiage dictionary .   if you 
ca> can't trust them with your words ,  who can you trust ? 
ca> - clickart business images :  a sampler of the clickart
ca> library .   perfect for importing into pfs : write documents . 
ca>  
ca> i bought this product 1 year ago for $129 .  its easy to use
ca> and turns out great-looking documents ,  even on a dot-matrix 
ca> printer .   so if you  want wysiwyg editing for your dos-computer 
ca> now ,  pfs : write is here !   
ca>  
ca> i'm looking to get $65 .   it comes with full
ca> documentation ,  registration cards ,  the box  ( its still in
ca> good condition )  ,  both 5 1/4 "  and 3 1/2 "  disks for pfs : write
ca> and grammatik ,  and the clickart on a 3 1/2 "  disk .  the
ca> utilities pfs : write comes with are worth $300 alone ,  so $65
ca> for a full-featured wp is a real bargain .   buyer pays
ca> shipping . 
ca>  
ca> please respond by email to carolan@owlnet . rice . edu

for studio use  ( ie :  they're very well built )  - 1 "  in diameter ,  6'
cord .   i'd like $15 ,  but i'd also like to sell them ,  so make me an
offer . 

	also i just bought a new ibanez guitar so i need to sell one
of my others .   it's a kramer with passive emg pickups  ( 2 single ,  one
double )  .   these pickups sound great and are whisper-quiet .   i'd like
to get $250 for it .

cod is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150 . 00
for a brick .  or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a cod it's fine till a stop payment is made .  there are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction .  even with
merchants and customers there are problems .  .  . stolen credit cards ,  
chargebacks ,  no return policies and getting the wrong item ,  etc . 

about the only protection available to to do business with someone you
trust .  .  .  . someone who has been around for a while .

a very good r&b group came out in 1988 called the pasadenas .   i bought their

  ^^^^^^^^

well ,  i'm not sure i'd go quite that far ,  but i agree that motorola
gear is of better quality .   the question is how much that quality
is worth to a ham in amateur service ,  not commercial service

>this radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without
> an antenna . 

ok ,  great .  but how often does that come up ?   how good is
 " good enough "  ,  and how much is someone willing to pay for it ? 
a good ham-quality ht is maybe $500 ,  while a commercial
quality one is maybe $2000 .  is the increased reliability and
performance worth 4 times the price *in amateur service* ? 
only the individual involved can answer that question ,  and each
ham has to decide for him/herself .   if motorola quality is worth
4 times the price to you ,  then more power to ya' .  but i'm amazed
that folks make that choice .  for ,  me ,  given that i've got $2000 to
spend ,  i'l pick the yaesu ht and a nice new hf rig every time over
a motorola ht alone ,  no matter how good it is .   to me ,  ham-quality
gear is  " good enough "  .  to each his own .  .  .

subject :  attention super nintendo and genesis players read this



im pleased to announce a new revolutionary device that allows you to
copy super nintendo and genesis games to floppy disk .   then later
play from floppy disk with out the cart .   this is a independent system
that interfaces with your snes or genesis . 

other features

*store multiple copies of cart .  save game to disk  ( up to 32 saves to disk ) 

*save your position in snes games that don't norally have a save feature

*switch your snes into slow motion mode

*use codes to get unlimited lives and other  " cheats "  in many games . 

the multi-game hunter is capable of copying both snes and genesis game 
carts to standard ibm pc formated floppy disks .  the games can them be played directly from the floppy disk .  note : it does not require a pc

full color on-screen icons and menus make operation for the mgh so simple
that even a child could operate it .   options can be selected simply by choosing the selection with the game controller and pressin a button . 

add a game saver adapter to your system for more game playing power .   the
game saver allows you to save your position to disk in almost any snes game ! 
reload your saved position any time .   enable it's slow-motion feature for those really tough games . 

for more control over game play ,  we have the game finger software .   the
game finger software can give you unlimited lives or warp you to new levels in
your favorite snes games .   bring back to life those really frustrating games . 

also if you know how to program 6518 6502 asm code you can create your own
snes demos or games . 

mgh includes

base unit , disk drive  ( high density 3 . 5 drive )  ,  16megabit ram ,  256 sram , 
all adapters and comes ready to hook up to your gameing system . 

only thing not included is the power supply which you can pick up at
radio shack . 

all for only $500

	i have some brand-new shrinkwrapped boxes of 8 "  floppy disks that i
would like to sell .   they are all 3m disks : 

40  ( 4 boxes of 10 )  ss/sd 8 "  floppy disks
60  ( 6 boxes of 10 )  ds/dd ,  w/wp 8 "  floppy disks

misco is selling the ss/sd 3m disks for 25 . 90 for a box of ten and they are
selling the ds/dd 3m disks for 31 . 90 for a box of ten .   i will take the
best offer i can get for the disks  ( as many boxes as you want )  . 

	i also have a quantity of 8 "  floppy disks that 
some people were getting rid of ,  probably due to an upgrade to a newer drive
system .   all the disks are used and most have labels on them ,  but they all 
appear to be in good physical shape .   however ,  i make no guarantees of the
quality of these disks .   here are the statistics : 

quantity	make	type

10		3m	single side/double density , soft sector , 128 bytes/record
66		memorex single side/double density , soft sector , 128 bytes/record

i will accept the best offer i receive for the disks and i'm willing to sell
them off in different amounts ,  the minimum being a box of ten  ( if i get no
offers on these disks i would considering throwing them in with the new
disks i'm selling above )  .  

i also have a head-cleaning kit for 8 "  disk drives for which i will take
the best offer i can get . 

all sales are final . 

i would prefer to ship cod and add the shipping costs onto the total order 
cost .

lots of comics for $1 ,  $2 ,  or $3 look at list !  !  !  !  ! 

shipping is $2 for 1-3 comics .   for more than 3 ,  the price will be determined by the volume of the purchase  ( i may have to use a big heavy box for large orders which costs more to mail )  . 

for all those who have bought comics from me ,  thanks !  !  ! 

all comics are near mint unless otherwise noted  ( my books were graded by
mile high comics and other comic professional collectors ,  not me !  )

subject :  optonica tuner and integrated amp forsale : 

i have an old optonica tuner and integrated amp that i no longer
use .   the integrated amp section does not work right now but should
not cost much to fix .   i believe that it is just a chip .   i have 
used it as a preamp and it works great ! 

this is a very nice looking and well built set .   they both are low 
profile but the amp is rather heavy . 

the tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp . 

the amp is rated at 75w/ch . 

these peices went for about $850 new . 

i would like to get $150 .   obo  for the pair .  

if anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp ,  i have had an estimate
done that it should cost less than $50 in parts . 

please email me if you are interested .   i will be moving back home for
the summer and will sell it back there if i do not do so here .

subject :  <very> bare 386/25 micronics system - $495

 " bare "  means what it says .  you get a case ,  a power supply ,  and a motherboard
 ( with ram and a coprocessor )  .  *everything* else is yours to add as you like . 

the case/power supply : 
  
     - standard desktop case .  230watt power supply with the usual connectors . 
     - room for five floppy/hard drives  ( three visible ,  two internal )  . 

the motherboard : 

    - us-made micronics 8-slot motherboard with intel 386dx/25mhz cpu
    - 64kb sram cache
    - 4mb 80us ram using 4x1mb simms  ( worth $150 alone ) 
    - cyrix 83d87 math coprocessor  ( worth $90 alone ) 
    - norton si 6 . 0 rating of 26 . 1
    - latest version phoenix bios


please do not post/email saying  " but i can get a taiwanese superclone
386/90 for only $9 . 95 including a free toaster !  "  .  i am *certain* you can
find a cheaper brand x board without even breaking a sweat .  *new* micronics
cpus command a several-hundred dollar premium because they are us-made , 
use high-quality components ,  and are known to be both very reliable and
compatible .  they have been oemed in systems sold by both gateway and
zeos at various points in the past .   ( check out the ads in the back pages
of byte or pc magazine if you want to see this price differential for
yourself .  ) 

price :  $495 complete ,  $100 less if you don't want/need the case and
power supply .  the board is fully guaranteed .  email for further details
or for any questions . 

thanks !

subject :  >>sale : bulk enviro t-shirts !  ! <<

i am not a company ,  thus this is not a commercial sale .   

i purchased 256 t-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through .  
we didn't have the time to sell the shirts .   i have about 175 shirts
left and i am willing to sell them to you for $5 . 25 a piece  ( more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts , 
even in bulk )    ( that's $918 . 75 for 175 shirts )   these shirts are jim
morris t-shirts .   they are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4
colors .    ( they are clean and neatly folded in a box .   if any happen to
be damaged i will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it ,  your option .  )   you could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece
 ( the higher number is for the nicer shirts )  to raise money for a school
event or a organization .   i realize it is a big investment ,  but it could
pay off big . 

i would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5 . 50 a
shirt .   i will pay shipping ,  but prefer local buyers and will give them
more bargaining power . 

please help me .   i do not have the time to sell these shirts and i need
the money .   i am taking a big loss by selling this cheap .   i will give
you jim morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices . 

all prices are negotiable .
