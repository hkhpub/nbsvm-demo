interesting .   tell us ,  what happens if i were to say ok ,  i want to have
something else .   if the law enforcement wants my traffic ,  they can record
it ,  then get a search warrant ,  and get the keys from me ,  just like they
would the keys to a stout private safe ,  etc .   ( lets say i suspect that
there is a way to trivially crack this at the fed level ,  with no warrant , 
say for nsa scanning for keywords ,  etc .  ,  and the government has abused
great power in the past .  .  .  )  . 

so i say  " mr vendor ,  i want something different ,  independent .   i am
a paranoid sort ,  ya understand .  .  .  "  . 

will the result be  " sorry ,  without government permission ,  we cannot sell
you anything secure "  ,  or would it be  " sorry ,  we know which side our
bread is buttered on ,  we cannot sell except to government people ,  law
enforcement ,  and 'special' people .  .  .  "  . 

what ,  in your opinion ,  would be the chances of  " sure ,  we will sell you
this secure system  .  .  .  be happy to .  .  .  " 

also ,  please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private
encryption of ,  say files transferred by modem ,  or ftp ,  or data stored
on disk ?   surely you have a feel for what the administration is planning
for us people on that .  .  .  .   with your rather intimate relationship with
the fbi ,  nsa ,  etc .  you must certainly have an idea .   you are surely
not going to say  " the people are not to know ,  until it is too late .  .  .  " 
this is supposed to be government of the people by the people ,  isn't
it ?   that is ,  the people are the government's bosses ?   the bosses
want to know what the *@ (  ) #*& ( @ is going on here .  .  . 

you see ,  i am kind of nervous ,  because in the last month or so ,  i have
seen a non-stop stream of ideas coming out of wash dc that at least
appear very strongly to have a common trait to limit privacy  ( freedom
from govt eavesdropping )  ,  and the ability to defend ourselves against
violent attack  ( no ,  911 is *not* good enough for 'common folk' ,  they
arrive only in time to clean up the mess :  i would be dead if i had to
depend on 911 .  .  .  )  .    you see ,  with all that talk about national smart
id cards ,  limiting of encryption to 'government approved' ,  denial of
means to effective personal defense  ( eight bills in congress right now )  , 
it looks an awfully lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace
every activity of an individual from cradle to grave .   all it would take
is requiring that national id card to be used in all transactions .  .  . 
and with no effective data protection ,  and with the people suitably
disarmed ,  there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it ,  now
would there ?   all in the name of the war on the constitu  .  .  .  er  .  .  . 
drugs ,  and of course that catch word 'terrorists' .   what is wrong with
good old-fashioned police work to build a case ?   they don't want to
have to be burdened to leave the office ,  it seems .  .  . 

please read the bill of rights  ( first ten amendments to the us
constitution )  and tell us how you can reconcile this big brother-ish
policy of the administration  ( always for a 'crisis' of some kind ,  isn't
it ?  )  with that bill of rights in the context of the people who wrote
it ? 

reassure us - please .  .  .   ( or is that no longer regarded as necessary , 
seeing as apparantly the people have no input on this agenda ,  the
administration preferring to make all the decisions in secret ,  then
springing it on us .  .  .  )  .   doesn't sound much like  .  .  .  by the people
to me .   i cannot help notice that the congress people involved were
not mentioned on the press release .   i find that more than a little
bit curious ,  don't you ?   i sure would like to know who to not vote
for come election time .  .  . 

yes ,  i am upset .   i feel you are a part of this ,  because i recall it
was you that was posting heavily in favor of a very similar idea  ( could
have been the same thing ,  it was so close )  a few months ago .  .  .   i
also recall it was not well received .   apparantly powers-that-be
really didn't care  ( or were not told ,  or both )  . 

from what i see ,  clipper will only be useful for conversations i don't
want the neighborhood kid listening in on .   any serious security i don't
think i would want to trust it a bit .   might as well use cleartext . 
certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious
trade-secret data ,  especially if millions depended on that security . 
given enough money ,  one could buy any keys they wanted .   buy a crooked
judge ,  and a crooked cop .    given a few hundred thou ,  they wouldn't be
hard to find .   so ,  we end up with only criminals ,  terrorists ,  and the
government with real security ,  and the ability to eavesdrop .   you know
the first two ,  if they are serious ,  ain't going to use this thing for
their communications .   i bet the government won't ,  either  ( except perhaps
to order a pizza )  . 

tell us ,  will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity , 
someone not using the 'government approved' methods ?   that just a desire
to have privacy is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an
unconnected citizen ?   will that be grounds for a fly-through-the-door
raid ,  and confiscation of all one's equipment ,  as 'terrorist tools' , 
using civil forfeiture ,  so there will be no inconvenient need to
prove any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen ? 

i have yet another question ,  are we going to see articles in all the
public magazines ,  consisting of soothing text telling us how great
this is ,  how nice the government is by letting us have this illusion
of privacy ?   that the government is going to be so kind as to let
us 'sort of' exercise a right ?   what you want to bet that i am
correct here ? 

please answer these questions .   as citizens of the united states ,  we
hava a right to know what our government plans to 'let' us have
out of the goodness of their hearts .  .  . 

funny thing ,  though - with all these proposals ,  i don't feel one bit
safer from drug dealers ,  terrorists ,  or a common street thug .   i am
beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities , 
or our own government gone out of control ? 

re-assure us ,  please .   so far ,  i haven't seen much to reassure me .  .  . 
and a lot to greatly disturb me .

  oh ,  that puts the debate on -excellent- terms for our side : 

  feds :   you people saying that clipper is insecure don't have any real
information to support that judgment . 
  me :   fine -- show me this  " information "  that would prove me wrong . 
  feds :   that's secret ! 

  when it comes down to that ,  it looks suspiciously like some government
official pasting  " top secret "  stamps over embarrasing information in order
to save his own hide .   in fact ,  framing the secrecy issue in that perspective
is more likely to turn joe sixpack's suspicions against the feds than the
constitutional argument -- a point i urge the others on the pro-freedom
side to consider when making their case .

subject :  re :  clipper considered harmful

 
   the clipper chip's user key is formed by : 
 
           r1 = e[d[e[n1 ; s1] ; s2] ; s1]
           r2 = e[d[e[n2 ; s1] ; s2] ; s1]
           r3 = e[d[e[n3 ; s1] ; s2] ; s1]
 
   why is the triple-encrytion used ?   is it just to gain an effective
increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch ?    ( if so ,  why use
80 bit keys ?  )   not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm ,  it's
not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
guess s1 , s2 . 
 
   why are n1 ,  n2 ,  and n3 formed as they are ?   it would be facinating to
see the skipjack algorithm ,  to look for ways of attacking it that require
three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way . 
 
   where do the 34-bit constant values that are concatenated with the
serial number to form n1 , n2 , n3 come from ?   are they changed from chip to
chip ,  or session to session ?    ( even if they're published in the ny times , 
if skipjack is resistant to known-plaintext attacks ,  when using triple-
encryption ,  then there's no break in security .   but why allow that kind
of weird format ?   if those three 34-bit values are truly-random bits ,  then
maybe it's used to ensure that a known-plaintext attack on skipjack ,  if
it exists ,  can't be easily used to derive s1 and s2 for a whole production
run of these chips .  .  .  .  ) 
 
   does dorothy denning read this group ?   if not ,  is someone on the group
forwarding questions like these to her ,  or martin hellman ,  or anyone else
who's seen more details about the chip ?

subject :  re :  is key escrow enough ? 

  the points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip ,  as
opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein ,  raise yet another trust
issue .   even if we assume that these  " trusted agents "  are really entering
a wide range of s1 and s2 seeds  ( rather than using the same one all the
time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits )  ,  i assume they are not
doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
at carefully selected points to encode data .   they would presumably be
punching numbers into a computer ,  which for all they know could program
the chips in a manner completely independent of the s1 and s2 values they
are feeding into the system .

you're blowing smoke .   qualcomm wants to sell to nice ,  lucrative overseas
markets like japan and the ec .   the government told them  " don't do encryption
if you ever hope to export this technology "  .   the reason that cdma doesn't

it's because qualcomm doesn't think that the us market for digital cellular
is big enough for them .   this is just the international traffic in arms

if you don't believe me ,  call qualcomm and ask them .   don't just throw

hah .   they're not that much more expensive .   besides ,  if a drug dealer

   i've been thinking about how difficult it would be to make pgp available
in some form on ebcdic machines .   the message authentication would be ugly , 
but i think at least the idea encryption could work ,  if pgp had a switch
to tell it to use idea in ofb-mode or ecb-mode .   in ofb-mode ,  errors in
translating ebcdic-->ascii-->ebcdic would only affect their byte ,  not the
16 bytes that would be affected under cbc . 
   is pgp set up to use different idea modes ?   i don't recall notincing it

should .  .  .  .

the censorship  of this internet  ( and it is no less than censorship [stupid me ,  it's the govt . ] ) 
is ridiculous .   the japanese have far outstripped our ciphertechnology ,   and 
our government is now ,  before your very observant eyes ,  trying to force the

relic in terms of modern japanese security techniques . 


now ,  i pose the question :  why censor folks on the net and send the warning

please don't be insulted ,  but based on this i would say that your
encryption algorithm is very likely not worth the paper it's printed
on .   if the nsa gave export approval ,  that means they felt confident
that they could crack it -- that's their job ,  mandated by law ,  and
i'm sure they believe in what they do .   if they gave export approval
to an encryption algorithm which they weren't confident of being able
to crack ,  they would be derelict in their sworn duty to monitor foreign
communications for us national security related material . 

just because many  ( most ?  )  of us think that the government and the spooks
are pugnacious slimeballs is no reason to lose sight of the fact that
they do their jobs to the best of their ability ,  and further that said
ability is rather high .   i hope that one day we can make them all
obsolete .  .  .  .  .  .  .  but until then ,  we have to cope with their existence . 
export approvals are one thing they do that we can learn a lot from , 
for example .

a person i know ,  belonging to a research lab of a rivate
company ,  claimed to me during a priavte conversation that ,  given the
equipment in his lab ,  he could crack a kerberos ticket in 15 minutes to
an hour .  he had access to rather powerful des hardware ,  but not of an
extraordinare kind ,  i believe .  the attack was possible because of the
amount of known plaintext in the ticket ,  which itself constitutes a small
message .  this was two years ago . 
des is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data .  for a
lot of purposes ,  however ,  it is still very adequate .

[story deleted]

let me give you another story that actually happened to me .   we sell
communications boards that use a 68000 .   they used to be high tech .  our
agent in the uk sold a system to a company in ch which packaged it in a
product for cz  ( london-bern-prague )  .   i telexed the brits and told them
the swiss need to pass export paperwork through the us as ,  at the time , 
you needed an export lisence for these systems . 

now i knew the nsa was watching this traffic  ( just like they are watching
this traffic .  ) 

and what do you know .  .  .  two weeks later an agent of the us government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the evil
empire ,  we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly . 

he was part of a five man office in columbus ohio !  !  who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal .   ( i assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there isn't
that much stuff coming out of columbus  :  ) 

wow ,  the electric utility in prague sure is a big worry for these folks  :  ) 

the point is ,  we have created a giant bureaucracy  ( nsa )  with a budget
bigger than the cia's who ,  like all bureaucracies ,  fill their time looking
for things to do .   the evil empire is gone .   the nsa is not .   they will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets .    ( i just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass .  .  .  but that is too
much to hope for .  .  .  they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like dorothy denning .  )   sigh .  .  .

you mean something like uuencode ?  it isn't super crypto ,  but it is encrypted .

i believe it's legal to send des code or equipment from the us to canada
with no export license .   i think this is the only place you can do this - all
other countries require a license . 

as an aside ,  i've always thought it should be legal to send des software
anywhere ,  if you follow these rules : 

   1 .   encrypt your des software with des . 
   2 .   send the encrypted software to the recipient . 
   3 .   send the key to the recipient . 

the only way the person on the other end can use your des software is if
he/she already *has* des available - otherwise ,  they can't decrypt your
program ,  and it is useless .   if you've guaranteed they already have des , 
have you really violated any law by sending it to them in the form of
your program ?  ?   i'm sure it's still illegal ,  but it seems like a good idea .  .  .

i seem to recall rush saying that he has a compuserve account .   if anyone
wants to e-mail him ,  all we need is his account number  ( i . e .  :  12345 , 6789 ) 
and then we could e-mail him via gateway by using a dot instead of a comma
like so :   " 12345 . 6789@compuserve . com "  .    ( this is *not* his address .  ) 

so ,  does anyone know his e-mail address ?   he *says* he uses it all the time .

good idea ,  but why put all the eggs in one basket ? 

given that the escrow keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks ,  why
not keep them there rather than creating one huge database that will have to
be guarded better than fort knox . 

give each floppy to a different bank for safekeeping .  the usa has over 10 , 000
banks and thrifts - there are not likely to be more than 2 , 000 , 000 clipper
phones sold .

hmmmmmm .   $30 seems a bit expensive .   how big is the chip ?   what kind

ok ,  i've got a big problem with all of this .   how in the world do you
expect to sell these chips for even $30 after all the overhead involved
in this programming procedure ?   2-4 people ,  a laptop ,  only 300 chips at 
a time :   give me a break .   and how long does all of this take ?   even if
it is a minute per chip ,  it will take the greater part of a day to 
turn out 300 of these things .   how long do you suppose it will take to
program those 10 , 000 chips mentioned above ?   this is highly impractical !

something similar has happened to me - ages ago when we were working on pgp
we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test 
new features around .   now at this time pgp  ( and certainly the newer version ) 
was unknown over here .   suddenly the admin at the site i was using received
a request that i stop sending encrypted email .   now there is almost no way
that some automatic scanner could have found this ,  since they wouldn't have
known about pgp - they *must* have checked for unknown data types in the
message ,  tried to unscramble it ,  found they couldn't get past the pem
armour part ,  and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop .   luckily
the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their
networks  : - )  . 

in case people think email scanning doesn't take place ,  i can assure you
that it is done regularly by many sites - usually not by government
agencies  ( or at least not that i know of )  ,  but by local administrators who , 
for reasons of their own ,  have decided to monitor all communications
 ( i'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons - stop hackers/
terrorists/child pornographers/drug dealers/evil commies/whatever )  .   there
have been several occasions when i've got people into trouble simply by
including the traditional nsa bait in a message  ( i don't try it any more
now  : - )  .   a friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of
the uk town of scunthorpe  ( hint :  look for words embedded in it )  .   i'm sure
there are many more examples of this happening  ( in fact if anyone has any
examples i'd appreciate hearing from them - i could use them as
ammunition during talks on privacy issues )  .

it is tempting  ( albeit chauvinistic )  to believe that we have a new situation
here ,  thanks to our pet computers .   this is not true .   david kahn's  " the
codebreakers "  ,  a history of cryptography ,  makes two things obvious : 

1 . 	cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals
	and has been going on for thousands of years .   [teen-age slang and
	cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous
	creation . ]

2 . 	the systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as  ( and
	sometimes more secure than )  those used by military and diplomatic
	users *of that time*  ( although they seem very simple and insecure
	today )  .  [e . g .  ,  in places ,  the bible used a more complex simple
	substitution than caesar did for his military dispatches ,  but before
	caesar . ]

i commend kahn's book to all who might be interested .

i don't think mr .  clinton can even understand the technical details of
the clipper encryption scheme .  so ,  his  " assurances "  are of no value at
al ,  if he gives them he just says what a panel of experts (  ?  )  told him .

you should realize that form letters are the *worst* way to influence
your congresscritters ;  exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest
rung of the opinion ladder . 

if you want to write  ( and i think you should !  )  ,  take the time to really
*write* a letter .   things to emphasize : 

	- it's been said that usenet is available to the 'technical
	  elite' ,  i . e .  the techies at corporate sites and universi-
	  ties .   emphasize that you are part of the group that will
	  be making/developing/using clinton's 'data superhighway . '

	- explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing
	  and data communications .   ( if this is the case ;  don't call your-
	  self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem .  )    this
	  will distinguish your letter from the random flamers .   don't
	  turn it into braggadocio ;  just tell them that you know the
	  technical sides of the issue . 

	- don't overdo jargon and gobbledygook .   remember ,  your letter
	  will be first read  ( in all likelihood )  by a staffer who may
	  even be a college student ;  if they don't understand it ,  your
	  views won't even make the 'running total' sheets . 

	- be concise ;  don't ramble .   rants are *definitely* out of place . 
	  cite references ,  if necessary ,  but only use  " accepted "  references
	  like academic journals .    " my neighbor jim "  is *not* a real refer-
	  ence .   8 ) 

	- unfortunately ,  very few congresscritters *really* understand
	  electronic communications .   encourage them to pick up access
	  to compuserve ,  america online ,  or one of the free-nets .   offer
	  to send them samples .   if you are in a position to do so ,  offer
	  them  ( or their staffers back in the home state )  access to your
	  systems .   offer to give a demonstration the next time they're in
	  town .   your offer to get *personally* involved in helping them
	  *will* give your opinions more credence . 

	- in addition to sending mail to your representatives ,  send mail
	  to the members of the committee  ( or subcommittee )  that is dealing
	  with the issue .   if your congresscritter isn't on the committee , 
	  they can't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor . 

--wes

ps> i'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the
    more traditional media ,  but usenet doesn't have a decent track record
    in the analogy department .   8 )

before they do some real damage ?  ?   you haven't been paying attention ,  it
seems .   the so-called war on drugs has already done major damage to
the us constitution .

he'll slam clinton for anything at all on the air .   i just do not
understand why he remains so popular .   he'll take a piece of video of
clinton walking along ;  find a frame in which clinton wrinkles his
nose ,  say ;  freeze on it and blow it up full screen ;  and then rant for
five minutes on how no one could possibly trust someone with such a
face and such beady greedy little eyes .   i've seen this on his tv show
 ( it was around the time of the inauguration )  .   can anyone call this
stuff legitimate  ( i hate to say  " informed "  )  commentary ?   how can
anyone with half a brain in his or her head[1] continue to watch
it[2] ? 

the american tv-watching  ( and i guess radio-listening )  public never
ceases to amaze me .

better ,  i think ,  is our right peacably to assemble .   i have a right to meet
you in a park and talk privately .   i have a right to see if anyone is
nearby ,  listening . 

in cyberspace ,  cryptography gives us a right to assemble with control over

there is one point i'd like to make ,  that most people seem to have forgotten . 
that is that one of the underlining principles in the constitution is a distrust
of governmental authority and control .  all those  " checks & balances "  is because
they realize that you should distrust those in power .  what everyone seems to have
forgotten as well is the original reason that the bill of rights guaranteed the
right to bear arms .  it's inclusion was not to allow you to protect yourself
against other citizens ,  but to prevent the government from taking away your only
means of protecting yourself from an armed and aggressive government .  its hard to
oppress your citizenry when its armed against you . 

i am not a fanatic ,  i'm a retired naval officer .  because i have spent so much
time defending it ,  perhaps i understand its  " purpose "  as well as its  " plan "  .

thats one problem that has so far been overlooked .  these two escrow
agencies will have to create a secure database and service the
input and output of keys .  who pays for this ?  if they refuse an
illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their
budget by cut to punish them ?  will congress be forced to fund
them forever ? 

the problem is that laws can change .  congress may pass a law setting
up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private .  some
future congress may change that law .  suppose pre-nazi germany had
a clipper system .  do you think the escrow agencies would have
told hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid 
court order ? 

in effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of
the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance .  
they will be able to directly tap into federal funds with no
accountability to anyone except through a court challenge .

i don't know about you ,  but i have nearly forgotten how to generate paper
mail . 

if i had e-mail to congress ,  i would have written many letters by now . 
i haven't written one yet ,  as it turns out .   writing on paper is such

this sounds an awful lot like a password-guesser ,  not a weakness in
des .   merritt and i pointed out this weakness in kerberos in a paper
that came out about 2 . 5 years ago ,  in both computer communications
review and usenix .   for that matter ,  it was loudly discussed on the
kerberos mailing list even earlier . 

the problem has nothing whatsoever to do with des ,  and everything to do
with bad password selection . 

i'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks
possible on des .   i'm quite dubious that private research labs know
them .   and the parameters of a brute-force attack are quite well
established ;  see ,  for example ,  the garon and outerbridge paper in the
july '91 cryptologia .   you're not going to do it in an hour with only
``rather powerful des hardware'' .   i'll leave the arithmetic as an
exercise for the reader .   on average ,  you'll need to do 2^55 trials . 
pick your own parameters for how fast the des engine runs ,  and for
how many such engines are used .

subject :  crypto-penpals

i came .  i lurked .  i read the faq . 

now having purchased the recommended books ,  and having taken to heart the advice that
one knows nothing about crypto without having done a stint as a cryptanalyst ,  i would like
to correspond with people interested in cryptology . 

i am working on implementing the cryptanalyst's workbench example in booch's ood with
applications .  i hope to start sending ciphers back and forth so each of us can practice cracking
them .   i would like to start with simple ceaser's ciphers and progress roughly according to
david kahn's book .  of course i would be interested in general discussions and math also . 

i hope to have some foriegn correspondants so that we can test the response time of the
 " men in the suits "  i've been hearing so much about .  unfortunately as a product of the american
education system i only know english . 

looking forward to any and all responses .

-----begin pgp signed message-----

gasp ! 

i've just spent 3 hours catching up on sci . crypt here  ( slow reader i
guess )  and i really have to put out a few comments too .   first ,  let me
flame the famous dave s .   :  he's obviously only 10 years old .   cut him
some slack .   : ^}

the joke about clinton/crypto/drugs slammed me thru the roof .   nice job
guys !   i've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years
now ,  clinton's actions so far have really helped .   but because of
government action taken against various other groups ,  i have developed
a 64 bit des based on public literature to protect my mailing list . 
the s-boxes are the critical component ,  and since i chose 32 out of 57
based on the key ,  cracking this des is going to tough .    ( the reason it
slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a
different set of s-boxes ,  i know it's only a vector ,  but it sure makes
random search a pain )  .   several marijuana legalization groups have had
their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug
use/sales .   it's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org , 
*but* you will be watched . 

it really is important to write a letter to every official you
personally vote for to explain *why* your privacy is being destroyed by
the  " cripple chip "  .   amazingly enough they do listen when they get
*enough* mail .   the doonsbery jokes about nra postcards are real ,  and
the imi  ( illinois marijuana initiative )  has grown to the point where we
*are* seeing some changes . 

it's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the
implimentation decision being made behind our backs .   as vesselin
points out ,  this was common practice in communist regimes  ( and may be
again depending on how the vote goes )  .   but just as criminals have guns
and  " law abiding "  citizens don't ,  and criminals like me have marijuana
and  " law abiding "  subjects don't ,  criminals like me will have secure
crypto while  " law abiding "  robots don't .   pgp is nice ,  but as time goes
on we all can do better .   and to save our hides we will . 

someone posted an excerpt from machiavelli .   he's my favorite dude . 
500 years ago he saw clearly how people *are* ,  and tried to explain
that to  " princes "  who wanted people to *obey* .   one section not quoted
 ( i've got  " the prince "  at home ,  so i'll just paraphrase  :  )   )  had to do
with conquring a free city .   the only way is to *completly destroy*
it .   failing that ,  you must appoint locals to high positions and accept
the people's customs .   even after 100 years of oppression ,  a people
will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive
government .   and he gave an example .   and that was 300 years *before*
thomas jefferson . 

there were questions about watching traffic .   only *interesting* traffic
is watched :  stuff that goes overseas and comes back ;  stuff with keywords
like marijauana ,  cryptography ,  nsa ;   certain individuals who are known
subversives ,  etc .   it is easy enough to store all that traffic .   so if
you know how to be *subversive* i . e .  how to be unseen ,  it's pretty easy
to go unnoticed for a long time .   the stronger your crypto system and the
less you're noticed ,  the better your chances of developing an organization
which can diseminate truth to the masses . 

which gets me to the thread about a  " public encrypted conference "  . 
that's just silly .   the first thing the feds do is send in an
infiltrator  ( like dave s .  )  and they know what you're doing .   it will be
fun for teenagers and college students ,  but for the real world it's
pretty pointless .   crypto is useful for more things than hiding where
you get your marijuana . 

guns ,  drugs and crypto do have some commonality :  there are people in
government who want you to *obey* their rules .   as lundquist says in
alt . drugs  " live free or don't "  .   machiavelli pointed out that's just
how most people actually live ,  inspite of appearences to the contrary . 
it's true that the decision to shove the clipper  ( not the same thing as
intergraph's !  !  !  )  down our throats violates the principles of what the
u . s .  was founded on ,  but the government is full of idiotic robots
called bureaucrats and there's less to worry about than one might
think .   only really innocent  ( read naive )  subjects of the u . s .  will be
hurt by this ,  the rest of us *criminals* will live in secure freedom . 
de toqueville pointed out 150+ years ago that the tyranny of the
majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government . 

and given what i see government officials doing where i work  ( argonne
national lab .  )  the level of stupidity makes dave s .  look smart .

   maybe so ,  but it's quite common .  there are millions of macintosh users who
   have no idea what's in apple's patented roms .  many have modems connected . 
   how do you know all your business secrets aren't being stolen ?  answer : 
   1 .  because you trust apple ; 
   2 .  because if any such attempt ,  however sophicsticated ,  came out ,  it would
   destroy apple's credibility forever . 

then there's also
3 )  because it's not secret .   if i want to ,  i can go look at apple's
copyrighted roms in a mac ,  so they're not keeping any secrets .   
you don't even have to pry the top off the chip and use an electron microscope , 
you just have to read the data in memory and see if you can figure out what it means . 
 ( motorola object code isn't all *that* obscure !  )   
yes ,  it's copyrighted ,  so i can't go selling copies ,  or using the copy myself , 
but i can see it ,  and disassemble it . 

4 )  they're not asking me to trust their honesty .   they're asking me to
trust the quality of their assembly language programming  : - )  , 
but i can see for myself what the performance ,  price ,  and crashes/day are . 
nsa ,  an organization not known for its honesty or openness ,  
is asking me to trust them with my privacy ,  but they won't trust me .   feh !

   you're blowing smoke .   qualcomm wants to sell to nice ,  lucrative overseas
   markets like japan and the ec .   the government told them  " don't do encryption
   if you ever hope to export this technology "  .   the reason that cdma doesn't
   have encryption is not because the g-men came a'knocking at qualcomm's door . 
   it's because qualcomm doesn't think that the us market for digital cellular
   is big enough for them .   this is just the international traffic in arms
   regulations all over again . 

perry has already stated on the net that qualcomm wanted to sell overseas ,  and
the government told them they wouldn't be allowed to export , 
so he's only blowing the same smoke you are  : - ) 
sure ,  they probably could have made a us version ,  and a non-crypto
export version ,  and contracted with a bulgarian or japanese software house to
develop an overseas crypto rom ,  but that's getting pretty expensive . 

   no ,  cylink sells their phones because they're willing to make different
   stuff for domestic use vs .  export .   qualcomm isn't .   so cylink makes
   money--that's capitalism ,  comrade . 

well ,  some people like capitalism ,  and others prefer free enterprise ; 
they're different !   using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist .

    " someone "  this and  " someone "  that .   if you think it's so easy ,  why are
   you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it ? 

writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do ; 
writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill . 
developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized , 
but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you don't
have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff . 
once the 586/pentium becomes widespread ,  or the next generation of
sound boards has dsps on it ,  i suspect we'll see it happen . 
maybe the vanilla 486+soundblaster is enough .

the easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured .  this makes
the funding separate from government . 

it also has the neat side property that if the chip doesn't catch on ,  the
scheme breaks down ,  and the government is back to the drawing boards , 
assuming that they haven't prohibited alternatives in the meantime . 

in fact ,  maybe this should be part of the  " official "  system .  before the
government is allowed to move this past the  " experimental "  stage ,  they
should have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption .  the
government is very fond of demonstration projects proving feasibility in the
use of government funds for social programs--they should have to make a
similar feasibility demonstration  ( on economic viability cum acceptance
terms )  for this baby as well .  let's put it to the only vote that counts--a
marketplace vote among those who have to pay for it .

meeting of the uk cryptoprivacy association
- -------------------------------------------

saturday ,  8 may 1993 ,  1500

to be held at the offices of : 

  forest
  4th floor
  2 grosvenor gardens
  london  sw1w 0dh

this is located at the corner of hobart place ,  a couple of
blocks west of victoria station ,  and almost directly across from

if you have trouble finding the place ,  please call the office on
071-823-6550 .   or ,  call me  ( russell whitaker )  on my pager , 
081-812-2661 ,  and leave an informative message with the
telephone number where you can be reached ;  i will return the
call almost immediately . 

discussion will range from the usual general topics ,  such as the
use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data ,  to
specific topics ,  such as recent moves by the u . s .  government
to restrict choice in data privacy  ( reference recent discussion
on usenet groups ,  e . g .  sci . crypt and alt . security . pgp )  . 

all are invited .   particularly welcome are members of the
newly-formed uk community group  .  .  .  the local
eff-in-spirit-if-not-in-name folks . 

those who plan to attend should email me and let me know . 
please . 

all attendees are requested to bring diskettes - preferably
ms-dos - with their pgp 2 . + public keys .   as is usual at these
gatherings ,  several of us will bring our laptops ,  and will sign
public keys ,  subject to the usual caveats  ( reference the
documentation for pgp 2 . 2 ,  specifically files pgpdoc1 . doc and
pgpdoc2 . doc )  . 

if you do not already have a copy of pgp 2 . 2  ( ms-dos )  ,  and would
like to have a copy of this public domain program ,  please bring
a formatted ,  medium or high density 3 . 5 inch floppy pc diskette ; 
you will be provided a copy of the program . 

of course ,  you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from
one of the various archive sites .   i suggest trying demon
internet systems ,  which carries the full range of pgp  ( phil
zimmerman's  " pretty good privacy "  )  implementations :  directory
/pub/pgp at gate . demon . co . uk . 

meetings are of indeterminate time .   those who are interested

one very interesting thing i notice about this is that the only use of
the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field . 
it is not used at all by the encryption algorithm . 

it seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be
otherwise compatible ,  but would send out a bogus law enforcement field . 
this might render the device unusable with  " normal "  devices if there's
some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field ,  but it
could certainly be used with other such modified devices . 

of course ,  this is irrelevant if the nsa has a backdoor in the
algorithm ,  but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system .

this article will just scratch the surface of a few security
considerations ,  comments are requested .   ( email :  fw@world . std . com ) 
my thanks to the people who responded ,  both on usenet and from
oracle corp . 

the most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit 
features or ops$ passwords to control access  ( opinion on ops$
included suggestions to use and not use )  .  i was also advised to 
use table views to refine the granularity of access control . 

one important security consideration in networked installations
is that ops$ accounts presume that the client host provides user
authentication .  os/2 server ops$ users are only as secure as the 
_least_ secure machine on the network .  hence you should probably 
not define any ops$ accounts on systems with pc's ,  or limit access 
of ops$ accounts to data with no security concerns .  unix oracle 
servers provide for disabling ops$ access over the network  ( orasrv
option )  ,  while relying on host security for local processes .  

internally oracle provides powerful and well documented  ( sic )  
audit mechanisms which the dba will use to monitor system and
data access .  these tools can be used to track the primary security
risks from within the oracle environment . 

oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of des
encryption .  oracle corp .  states that the algorithm is not prone
to cleartext attack .  this is a difficult claim to substantiate 
since the algorithm is unknown .  the concern here is that if users 
choose easily guessed passwords .  _if_ a cracker can gain access 
to your oracle database files through the host operating system ,  
s/he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply 
cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords . 

as security risks go ,  the above scenario is pretty low severity . 
certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files , 
s/he can access to the data in them .  if a cracker _could_ break 
the passwords ,  however ,  s/he could do substantial damage without
alerting the auditing mechanism's ,  and leaving and audit trail
which would point to valid users .  at present oracle  ( like unix ) 
provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not 
guessable .  

as with all computer security ,  the most important defense is to 
educate users in the safe choice of passwords .  these techniques
are well discussed in internet rfc#1281 and the crack manual ,  
 ( both available from ftp archive servers )  and ,  unix ( r )  system 
security  ( curry ,  david a .  - addison-welsey 1992 )

this analogy fails in its assumption that the government gives two
squirts about credibility . 


in addition ,  apple's proclaimed purpose in releasing the macintosh wasn't
survellience . 

quite the opposite : 
 " on january 24 ,  apple will introduce .  .  .  .  macintosh ,  and you'll see why
1984 won't be ,  like '1984' " 

so don't give me any bullshit analogies about how we trust coke not to
put mind control drugs in every can to get us to buy more .

one of the reasons we should be all the more suspicious .   when was the
last time the president wasted his time to comfort americans ? 
just another reason to look closely at exactally what's going on .

pat myrto says if law enforcement wants keys ,  let them get a court order and

most use of probably cause wiretapping warrants isn't to decrypt historical

pat's approach would tip off the crooks .

well ,  they can't listen in on much of mine ,  since i already use
cryptography for much of my electronic mail ,  and will start using it
for my telephony as soon as practical . 

however ,  allow me to tell a parable . 

there was once a far away land called ruritania ,  and in ruritania
there was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in
ruritainia were transparent .  now ,  in the days when people had lived in
mud huts ,  this had not been a problem ,  but now high-tech wood
technology had been developed ,  and in the new age of wood ,  everyone in
ruritania found that their homes were all 100% see through .  now ,  until
this point ,  no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on
someone's home ,  but the new technology made this tempting .  this being
a civilized country ,  however ,  warrants were required to use binoculars
and watch someone in their home .  the police ,  taking advantage of this , 
would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going
on .  occassionally ,  they would use binoculars without a warrant ,  but
everyone pretended that this didn't happen . 

one day ,  a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house , 
suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will .  things
would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely
private . 

indignant ,  the state decided to try to require that all homes have
video cameras installed in every nook and cranny .   " after all "  ,  they
said ,   " with this new development crime could run rampant .  installing
video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --
they are just keeping the old one .  " 

a wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the
lives of the police easy ,  that the police had survived all through the
mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will ,  and that
ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was
expedient was permitted .  for instance ,  in a neighboring country ,  it
had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to
solve crimes .  ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its
expedience .  indeed ,   " why have warrants at all "  ,  he asked ,   " if we are
interested only in expedience ?  " 

a famous paint technologist ,  dorothy quisling ,  intervened however .  she
noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating
should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards , 
and the law was passed . 

soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths
while speaking to each other ,  thus preventing the police from reading
their lips through the video cameras .  this had to be prevented ,  the
police said .  after all ,  it was preventing them from conducting their
lawful surveilance .  the wise man pointed out that the police had never
before been allowed to listen in on people's homes ,  but dorothy
quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of
covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and
mutilation of children .  no one in the legislature wanted to be accused
of being in favor of mutilating children ,  but then again ,  no one
wanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked ,  so a
compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with
microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras .  the wise man
lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old
lip reading technology ,  but it was too late -- the microphones were
installed everwhere . 

however ,  it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent
citizens from hiding information from the authorities ,  because some of
them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not
understand .  a new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at
all times only in ruritanian ,  and ,  for good measure ,  to require that
they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones .   " after all "  , 
dorothy quisling pointed out ,   " they might be using the opportunity to
speak in private to mask terrorist activities !  "   terrorism struck
terror into everyone's hearts ,  and they rejoiced at the brulliance of
this new law . 

meanwhile ,  the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all
of this was making a sham of the constitution of ruritania ,  of which
all ruritanians were proud .   " why "  ,  he asked ,   " are we obligated to
sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police
easier ?  there isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in
crime anyway !  all it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state !  " 

however ,  the wise man made the mistake of saying this ,  as the law
required ,  in ruritanian ,  clearly and distinctly ,  and near a
microphone .   soon ,  the newly formed ruritanian secret police arrived
and took him off ,  and got him to confess by torturing him .  torture
was ,  after all ,  far more efficient than the old methods ,  and had been
recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene
thoughts about tomatoes ,  which dorothy quisling noted was one of the
major problems of the new age of plenty and joy .

   glad to !   you are correct ,  it is illegal to send cryptographic
code  ( and lots of other things )  out of the country without a license . 
however ,  every us citizen has a general export license ,  allowing
export of lots of things ,  including constitutionally protected speech . 
this has the effect that it is legal for us citizens to export some
things which it is illegal for a us corporation to export without
first obtaining a license . 

   > dunno if you'd get one for the particular code you have ;  the only

   nope ,  talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law .   but ,  in
general ,  the government has to have a very good national security case
to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to
publish .    ( yes ,  i worded that the way i did intentionally .   it is a
lot easier for the government to try to prevent the export of
information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact . 
espionage is probably the only exception .  )

    if you are a us citizen ,  you have a general license .    ( i am not a
lawyer ,  so take some of this with a grain of salt .   however ,  i have
also had to swim through both itar and export regs in a few cases .  )

we would like to keep it that way .  thats the point .  by reacting
strongly and forcefully now ,  we will assure that we continue to remain
free .  you cannot overreact to a threat like this .  the worst that
happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort .  the worst that
happens if we underreact is tyranny .  i prefer overreaction myself .

doesn't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is ? 

only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain
ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom .  i suggest that
overreacting now and in the future is a good thing .

subject :  how to make the clipper chip and wiretapping less bad

   i've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints
i have about the clipper chip .   pass a law stating that if ,  within a
year of performaing a wiretap on someone ,  a police agency hasn't
managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant/wiretap was for , 
then that agency owes the suspect $1 million to repay him/her for
lost privacy . 
   of course ,  there are *still* problems with the technical aspects of
clipper ,  and with the one-size-fits-all mentality that would be behind
an attempt to enforce it as a standard .   but this would be a way for
those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will
only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are
all but certain that there really will be a conviction .  .  .  .

	again we have the trust in government problem here .  members of 
mr .  sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which
members of my generation find ridiculous .  i would suggest that mr .  sternlight
read about the cointelpro program ,  or about j .  edgar hoover ,  or about
the wire-tapping of martin luther king ,  then ,  after he has digested this
information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not
tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations
that they have no right to ,  even under their own laws .  given the long
history of members of the us government ignoring the laws that apply
to them ,  it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid ,  and
given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these
individuals once they are discovered ,  it is no wonder that so many people
in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for clipper .

\maketitle

a message-digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a
``digest'' of fixed length ,  and has three properties :  computing the
digest is easy ,  finding a message with a given
digest---``inversion''---is hard ,  and finding two messages with the
same digest---``collision''---is also hard .  message-digest algorithms
have many applications ,  including digital signatures and message
authentication . 

rsa data security's md5 message-digest algorithm ,  developed by ron
rivest \cite{rfc-md5} ,  maps a message to a 128-bit message digest . 
computing the digest of a one-megabyte message takes as little as a
second .   while no message-digest algorithm can yet be {\em proved}
secure ,  md5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps
to a 128-bit digest .   inversion should take about $2^{128}$
operations ,  and collision should take about $2^{64}$ operations .   no
one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision . 

recent work by den boer and bosselaers \cite{den-boer-md5} presents
a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in md5's
internal compression function ,  which maps
a 512-bit message block $x$ and a
128-bit input state $s$ to a 128-bit output
state .  they show how to find a message block $x$
and two related input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ that yield the same
output state :  $f ( x , s_1 ) $ = $f ( x , s_2 ) $ .  their well-thought approach
exploits structural properties of the collision function to find 
a pseudocollision in about $2^{16}$ operations ,  much less than one
would expect . 

practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of
md5 are not evident .  while a real collision in md5 implies a
pseudocollision  ( or a ``pseudo-inversion'' )  ,  a
pseudocollision need not imply a real collision .  indeed ,  a real
collision ,  since it involves two different messages ,  would almost
always involve {\em different} message blocks $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that
$f ( x_1 , s_1 )  = f ( x_2 , s_2 ) $ ,  but the pseudocollisions have the same
message blocks .  moreover ,  the input states $s_1$ and $s_2$ would
generally be unrelated ,  but the pseudocollisions' input states are
the same except for four bits .   there does not seem to be any way to
extend den boer and bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the
special pseudocollisions ,  a limitation they readily admit . 

it is reasonable ,  therefore ,  to believe that md5 remains secure .  while den
boer and bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in
md5 ,  the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions
and not anything approaching real collisions .  further research ,  of
course ,  will give a better understanding of the strengths of md5 and
other message-digest algorithms ,  with the eventual hope that
such algorithms can ,  in some sense ,  be proved secure .

subject :  re :  suggestions for escrow agencies  ( was :  re :  more technical details ) 

in article <strnlghtc5ybka . dp5@netcom . com> strnlght@netcom . com  ( david sternlight )  
brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid ,  and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate . 
it's an important issue ,  especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service .  
i assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government , 
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys . 

>   the easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured .  
>   this makes the funding separate from government . 

but who's the user paying the fees here ,  and what's the service ?   
if the user is the government ,  then the funding's not separate from the government . 

if the user is the buyer ,  what's the service ?   
keeping the key for me ?   no thanks - i don't need ,  and won't buy their service ! 
not telling everybody my key ?   sounds like blackmail ! 

if the user is the manufacturer ,  does the user have a choice about buying ? 
the alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it ,  which is fine -
i'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key ! 

face it ,  the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want . 
the only people who want it are the government ,  not the users . 
what you're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service ,  up front or per-year ,  either from general taxes , 
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips ,  or on an indirect tax
 ( forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent .  ) 

i hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number ,  especially if the escrow is a government agency . 

here in new jersey ,  we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees .   there are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee ,  though sometimes people
refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective . 
if you go to a baseball game at yankee stadium ,  there are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee . 
something could scratch the paint ,  after all . 
and what a shame if your clipper key got out !

subject :  re :  how to make the clipper chip and wiretapping less bad

what is the reason for the push on clipper ? 

two days after the lead story here in the mercury times  ( murky news ) 
there was another article on industrial espionage by the french . 

someone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have
continued access to our communications ,  they already have it .   the
problem is that ,  yes the do have access ,  and probably more than
we realize .   the government wants exclusive access to communications
intercept here in the united states ,  cutting out other access detrimental
to the national security  ( tm )  . 

i also doubt that a certain3 letter agency ,  that originated the encryption
algorithm and the chip designs needs to have anything to do with the 
escrow system to continue their intercept effort .   

better yet ,  who owns the company doing the programming ?

my choice for the escow house would be the smithsonian ,  and someplace on
the west coast .   my biggest concern isn't that the escrow house could
be compromised  ( it will be )  ,  but the fact it has been compromised will
be kept secret .   

the keys could be kept under glass ,  with 24-hour c-span coverage .   if you
thought your key had been stolen just turn on the cable ,  and wait until
the roving camera reachs the musuem case with your key .   or if you think the
c-span satellite has been compromised ,  take a tour of the smithsonian
yourself ,  and view the seal on your key .

first of all ,  it's not the thought police ,  it's the export police . 
if you move overseas with your great thoughts in your head ,  write the software there ,

however ,  if you write the program here ,  and sell it to furriners , 
you are now an international arms dealer and can get thrown in the

and cuban drug dealers and fanatic middle eastern terrorists buy your stuff . 

 ( definitions of  " public domain "  are different for itar purposes ,  so if
you've got a good enough lawyer who'll do your case for free after
they've confiscated everything you own as evidence ,  you might win . 
but nobody wants to go first ,  since the stakes are _quite_ high .  )

	well ,  actually ,  this one's easy .  it's their job .  the nsa is
supposed to develop cryptosystems .  if the government chooses to go
ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses ,  so be it . 

	this sounds a lot like slamming the competition ,  not a cry
for justice .  these guys are way out on a limb ,  if i read that right . 
they've commited their new algorithm to silicon before it's been
made public .  what are they gonna do if shamir writes a paper showing
how to crack the entire class of algorithms in 5 minutes with a slide
rule and a pencil ? 

	if they weren't busy throwing muck to smear their competitors , 
i'd feel kinda sorry for 'em .  still do ,  a little .

thank you andrew .   not only for the firm rebuttal ,  but for understanding the 
difference between communism and socialism  ( even though this is off topic )  . 
why do people just not understand that just because all those pretty songs about
the land of the free and so on sound nice ,  that they may not be true ? 
take off those rose colored glasses and get a clue  ( to use two of the better

i've posted some info on celp coding on sci . crypt .   looks like you can
squeeze speech into 4000bps if you have a fast enough computer like a
sparcstation  ( or a newton with the acorn risc machine in it  : - )   ) 

this drops the bandwidth to so low a figure that it's feasible to run
speech over tcp/ip running on top of slip down a v32bis modem .   not only
will this let us run point to point encrypted speech ,  it'll let us
run speech internationally over the internet if no-one stops us by
getting *very* heavy about regulations .   the thought of this ,  if the
administration realised ,  would probably scare them shitless . 

now of course the trick is to develop and define a standard protocol
for internet speech *damn fast* ,  allowing anyone who feels brave to
inplement custom handheld hardware as well as us hacking it on our
workstations .   shouldn't be too difficult .   the celp stuff is standardised , 
we use tcp/ip streams ,  and a protocol allowing silences to be used to
catch up on any net lag ,  and also to avoid sending any data during
silences  ( ie it's not wise to be synchronised real-time on each end
because any net delays would add up to big voice-lags ) 

as for me ,  i'm going to press ahead on trying this stuff as soon as
i get my sparc back from being loaned out and buy the necessary microphone . 
it'll save me a fortune in calling my friend in texas every night  :  ) 
 ( whether encrypted or not ) 

you know ,  surely *someone* is working on this .   who ?   it's so obvious , 
why doesn't it exist already ?   i've only seen netphone for suns and
it didn't do the celp compression so was restricted to ether connections .

since the fbi's account of what happened is being contradicted on an
increasingly frequent basis by other officials investigating the
fire ,  the most pernicious idea of all is believing that big brother
is going to be well-behaved with respect to cryptographic keys . 

in light of the very serious allegations with respect to the doj
selling software to various other intelligence services ,  what do
you suppose the chances are of some future doj selling escrowed
keys to business firms ? 

trusting the government to be honest and fair is putting the 
fox in charge of protecting the chickens .

the proposal could be modified so that if they get a court order to tap you
and don't charge you with a crime within ,  say ,  90 days ,  they have to buy you
a new phone . 

if they do charge you ,  and you are found innocent ,  they have to buy you a

khufu and khafre are both patented  ( #5003597 )  .   biham and shamir showed
that differential cryptanalysis can break 16-round khafre with a chosen-
plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions .   khafre with 24 rounds
can be broken with the same attack using 2^53 different encryptions . 
 ( there are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks ,  if
someone wants to take the time to look .  ) 

khufu has key-dependent s-boxes ,  and is immune to differential cryptanalysis . 
source code for this algorithm  ( and khafre )  are in the patent . 

snefru is a public-domain one-way hash function .   the version of snefru
that produces a 128-bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis
 ( vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force )  for
four passes or less .   given that ,  sha and md5 are much more efficient . 

oh yes ,  anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact dave petre , 
director of patent licencing for xerox ,   ( 203 )  986-3231 .

yes ,  but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to
go back and use the phone with the new key instead of the phone whose
key they obtained ? 

it is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks
messages recorded  ( by whomever )  at earlier times .  the announcement was
silent on this .  the betting seems to be that once your key has been
obtained  ( by the authorities ,  by divorce lawyers ,  by the mafia ,  by the
fbi ,  by lost or stolen backup tapes ,  by the nsa ,  etc .  )  .  all previous
conversations are unsecure .   ( session keys are negotiated ,  but knowing
the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the
security .  no doubt more details will emerge .  ) 

so ,  the loss of a key ,  whether one is guilty or innocent ,  may mean a lot
more than merely replacing the phone . 

sort of like saying to someone ,   " oh ,  i copied your diary .  but i'll buy
you a new one .  " 


and the system ,  if made mandatory  ( as i expect )  ,  will make such
storing of conversations much easier ,  i fear .  for one thing ,  the
transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone
listening ,  a kind of  " caller id "  and  " callee id "  on a grand scale . 
also ,  the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the
privacy of the calls ,  as they perceive them all to be useless
encrypted junk .   ( this is a bit of a reach ,  i know ,  suggesting that the
clipper will make security more lax .  .  .  )  . 

anyway ,  still lots of issues unresolved .

perry is right on target here .  careful analysis of the clipper chip
announcement reveals that is *not* likely to remain  " voluntary "  for
very long .  .  . the cost of the system ,  the cost of generating and _then
storing_ the escrow keys ,  and the admitted security holes pretty much
make the clipperphone a loser . 

strong crypto will outcompete it ,  if strong crypto is allowed .  this is
the battle we face . 

we had rumblings of this totalitarian key registration thing a while
back ,  and now the other shoe has dropped .  the firestorm of commentary
and criticism this time around reveals the almost immediate revulsion
this wiretap chip  ( and automatic caller id and callee id ,  don't
forget !  )  generates in everyone ,  or almost everyone ,  who hears about
it . 

this is a battle we can't afford to lose .

do not presume to tell me what i have and have not read .   the system may
not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units ,  but
it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some
suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys
from escrow .   this necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal's
coercing or colluding use of some other person's clipper phone . 

i will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument . 
the original title perhaps should have been  " distinction between legal
and illegal cipher systems considered harmful "  ,  but  " clipper considered
harmful "  is not inaccurate ,  and is more eye-catching in the current context . 

assumptions : 

  1 .   clipper is made available . 

  2 .   laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than clipper illegal
       ( either on radio systems ,  or on any common carrier system )  .   these laws
      also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio
      spectrum  ( or other medium )  ,  characterize signals ,  validate clipper
      wrappers ,  detect probable use of non-clipper ciphers ,  and make such
      detection a cause for further action . 

  3 .   for escrowed keys to be useful ,  some specific clipper chip must be
      associated with a suspected criminal .   this means that at a minimum
      some association between the common carrier's unique phone id  ( esn )  and
      the clipper chip serial number n will be stored in a government database . 
      an observed pairing of n and esn other than the one recorded raises a
      red flag . 

  4 .   to reduce ordinary fraud ,  the cellphone system which offers clipper
      will also be constructed with an esn mechanism much more tamper-proof
      and much less spoofable than today's cellphones . 

  5 .   criminals want inscrutable communications .   some criminals are not
      entirely stupid or ignorant ,  and will figure out both that clipper
      cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances ,  and that
      they offer no security against law enforcement once a  ( presumably
      legitimate )  wiretap order exists .   they will also figure out that the
      wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone ,  because
      each one has a unique unit key . 

  6 .   criminals do not want to call attention to themselves .   because they
      are not stupid or ignorant  ( or because they read netnews )  ,  and because
      they know that their open use of a non-clipper cipher is likely to be
      detected ,  they will generally avoid using non-clipper ciphers directly
      on some monitorable/tappable channel .   they know that do so would raise
      a red flag ,  putting a given cellphone  ( if not a given person )  under
      immediate suspicion . 

  7 .   it is impractical to reverse engineer skipjack ,  discover family key f , 
      and construct a functional clone of a clipper chip . 

by #2 ,  #3 ,  #4 ,  and #7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given clipper
phone without immediate detection .   because it is difficult to obscure one's
association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips
around ,  the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is
associated with someone else . 

a non-stupid criminal will conclude that they can have clipper-secure
communications ,  at least for some limited time t ,  if they buy ,  beg ,  borrow , 
or steal use of someone's phone in a way that prevents that person from
reporting compromise of the phone for at least time t .   the encrypted
communications might have been recorded ,  and thus be retrievable later , 
but the criminal can delay ,  and quite likely evade ,  discovery by destroying
or abandoning the phone before t elapses . 

it would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their clipper
phone to someone else .   the honest subscriber doesn't want to pay someone
else's bill ,  and he doesn't want to fall under suspicion . 

this leaves two sources of clipper phones for criminal use :  coercion
and collusion . 

coercion first .   theft bears a relatively low risk ,  but also sometimes
a low time until detection  ( a few minutes if a phone is stolen from
a car parked in front of a store ,  a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen
from someone who is away on vacation )  .   criminal commerce is likely to
arise in stolen clipper phones ,  with phones coming from risk-inured poor
criminals ,  and cash coming from risk-averse wealthy criminals .   someone
who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected
communication  ( like a terrorist )  could kill a person or hold them hostage . 
the limited time  ( before detection )  that a coerced phone is useful means
that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of
freshly coerced phones . 

there would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively
wealthy criminals ,  and ignorant or don't-care patsies who need money , 
and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to clipper
phone service for someone else's use . 

criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a
clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non-clipper cipher to a normal
cellphone .   they will call much less attention to themselves  ( or at least to
their stolen phone )  this way .   the fact of a phone's use being coerced must
first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone ,  and
have its keys obtained from escrow . 

clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of super-encryption .   an automated full-system surveillance
mechanism  ( quite feasible across radio bandwidth )  which knows family key f , 
can validate clipper wrappers and n : esn associations ,  but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of super-encryption ,  unless it knows all unit keys , 
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces ,  upon specific wiretap-like order . 

whereas a criminal's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium
would stand out ,  a criminal's use of a non-clipper cipher within a clipper
medium would be very difficult to detect ,  even ex post facto in bulk
recordings ,  as long as the association between criminal and specific clipper
chip is fractured . 

if you make use of this other cipher illegal per se ,  then you can charge
the criminal with this  ( if you can identify the true criminal - he'll be
using someone else's phone )  ,  but you'll have no evidence to help you against
whatever traditional crime he might have been planning .   you will not even be
able to detect that unusual  ( encrypted )  communications are occurring until you
identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow . 

the gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more ,  not less ,  secure than
they were before clipper came along . 

i therefore consider clipper harmful because : 

  1 .   it does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against
      aggressive or dishonest government . 

  2 .   if other ciphers are proscribed ,  it engenders new types of direct
      criminal threat to the honest public . 

  3 .   it provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to
      hide their use of some other cipher ,  making it more difficult than
      ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring
      and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress . 

  4 .   if other ciphers are proscribed ,  lazy investigators and prosecutors
      are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher-use crime
      than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key
      escrow is claimed to help against . 

  5 .   if other ciphers are proscribed ,  the stage is set for witch hunting
      of  " illegal "  cipher use .   because any computer can be used as a cipher
      machine .  .  .

subject :  clipper serial numbers need 2nd court order ? 

something that no one has discussed yet  ( or i missed it )  : 

the fbi sets up a wiretap after the court order was handed .  
only at this point they can access the line and detect 
the serial number n . 

what happens next ,  does the fbi simply asks for the keys
for n ,  and ,  since a warrant was issued for the line ,  the fbi 
simply gets it ?  what if multiple phones are used from the
same house ,  the fbi just asks for n1 ,  n2 ,  etc .  ? 

exactly who is to prevent the fbi from claiming some
other serial number ,  x ,  was also used over the wirtapped 
line and get the keys for x ?  

either a second court order  ( for the specific serial/key ) 
is required  ( and i have seen no indication of this )  ,  or
the fbi can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any
time ,  so the escrow key holders are a total fake . 

an unrelated issue :  if and when all phones always use
the clipper chip ,  how are call-transfers going to take 
place ?  !

  well ,  that explains it .   the government has no real need to spy on people
who already love big brother ;  it's the people who are inclined to talk
back who need to be watched .

  ah ,  but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the government's domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate ,  into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping .

  on the contrary ,  the entire clipper proposal is an example of the
government servicing the people  ( in the sense of the term found in the
sentence ,   " the farmer paid $100 to rent a bull to service his cows .  "  )

subject :  re :  is key escrow enough ? 

	  the points raised about checking what is actually -in- the chip ,  as
	opposed to what is allegedly programmed therein ,  raise yet another trust
	issue .   even if we assume that these  " trusted agents "  are really entering
	a wide range of s1 and s2 seeds  ( rather than using the same one all the
	time to reduce the key search space to 30 bits )  ,  i assume they are not
	doing so by picking up an iron filing and poking it into the circuitry
	at carefully selected points to encode data .   they would presumably be
	punching numbers into a computer ,  which for all they know could program
	the chips in a manner completely independent of the s1 and s2 values they
	are feeding into the system . 

s1 and s2 are clearly the backdoor - we should assume they are all
compromised .   if they're not compromisable ,  why the hell not use a
hardware true random number source .   there isn't a random number
source *anywhere* in this proposal .   the whole thing is deterministic
from the day the serial number is stamped on the chip . 

nope ,  it can't be trusted .   this is all about two levels of access -
the  ( possibly honest )  key escrow that police forces have to use ,  and
ostensibly the fbi ;  and the back door that lets the nsa decode *everything*
on the fly - and maybe some back-handers to the fbi when they want a
warrantless tab in exchange for favours .

	you obviously haven't read the information about the system .  the chips
	put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow

you forget the obvious !  if it is an *authorised* tap then it can be done at
the exchange .  if the exchange is *digital* then i suspect that you can
auto-monitor a line and pickup the full link .  therefore syncing a piggyback
modem on the line would not be impossible - i suspect .

i may be misreading you here .   are you saying the american revolution 
wasn't a good idea because it was bad odds ? 

i kind of doubt that any revolution ,  armed or otherwise ,  was ever started 
without vast amounts of failed  " working within a system "  .   a good sign of 
a system being not worth preserving would probably be that very inability 
to work within it productively .

is the u used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the
call ,  from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first , 
or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field ?   even assuming
one of the first two choices ,  the fbi is going to get a fresh n , u for its
own database about every other phone call ,  eventually accumulating keys for
all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring ,  not just
the 'suspects' key .    ( assuming the ever-thrifty fbi doesn't forget each key
after its wiretap permission has expired .  )   not quite a pyramid ,  but not
bad ,  either .

clipper tm chip is a registered trademark of intergraph corp . 

the so-called clipper chip which was recently mentioned here
and in other media
with respect to encryption is being used in violation of that trademark .   

the intergraph clipper chip is a unix microprocessor ,  originally 
developed by fairchild semiconductors ,  and has no relationship
to the encryption chip whatsoever .

hello all , 
i thought you all might like to see this .  it's a letter from jerry
berman to david chaum from november of 1985 ,  in response to
information that mr .  chaum sent to mr .  berman . 

while i have to congratulate eff for its prompt response to the
clipper chip announcement from the white house ,  i think it's important
to recognize the philosophy of their executive director ,  as explained
below . 

i agree that legal remedies are important ,  but when pressed ,  i'd
prefer to retain the ability to use purely technical solutions to
preserve my privacy ,  because they'll hold up under fire . 

mr .  chaum has consented to the publication of this letter on the net .  

i don't work for ,  nor am i a member of eff ,  aclu ,  or any similar
organizations ,  but i do agree with them on a great many things .

	thank you for sending me a most interesting article .    a
society of  individuals  and  organizations  that  would  expend  the
time and resources to use a  series  of  'digital  pseudonyms' to
avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother
obsolete but  acts  on  the  assumption  that  big  brother  is  ever
present .   i  view  your  system  as  a  form  of  societal  paranoia . 

	as a matter of  principle ,   we  are  working  to  enact  formal
legal protections for  individual  privacy  rather  than  relying  on
technical solutions .    we want to  assume  a  society  of  law  which
respects legal limits rather than  a  society  that  will  disobey  the
law ,  requiring  citizens  to  depend  on  technical  solutions .   e . g . 
require  a  judical  warrant  for  government  interception  of  data
communications rather than  encrypt  all  messages  on  the  assumption
that regardless of the lawt  the  government  will  abuse  its  power
and invade privacy . 

	as a  matter  of  practicality ,   i  do  not  think  your  system
offers much hope for privacy .     first ,  the trend toward universal
identifiers  is  as  much . -a  movement  generated  by  government  or
industry's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by
citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions . 
at best ,   your  system  would  benefit  the  sophisticated  and  most
would opt for  simplicity .   the  poor  and  the  undereducated  would
never use or benefit from it . 

	finally where there's a  will ,  there's  a  way .  if  government
wants to link data bases ,  it  will ,   by  law ,  require  the  disclosure
of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it
for data bases which the government wants to link .       since
corporations  make  money  by  trading  commercial  lists  with   one
another ,  they will never adopt  the  system  or  if  it  is  adopted , 
will use  " fine printn  contracts  to  permit  selling  various   codes
used by their customers to other firms . 

	the solution remains law ,  policy ,  and consensus about limits
on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual
autonomy .   technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to
override it .  it cannot be used as a substitute for such
consensus . 



                                            sincerely yours ,

subject :  information on mathematics of cryptography  ( followup ) 

i posted an informational request about any electronically available
articles on cryptographic algorithms a couple of days ago .   as i
mentioned ,  i was interested ,  in particular ,  in des and public-key --
but also wouldn't mind learning about others .   as i said ,  i can read
an intro-graduate level text book ,  having had some mathematics ,  though
not much number-theory per se .   i'd like to see the technical details
of the mathematics of cryptography ,  as oppossed to the popularizations
of things like _scientific am_ which just say ,   " then you find a
*really* big prime number .  .  .  .  "  . 

following my request ,  several people were so kind as to suggest
reading-lists ,  which i hope to get around to .   two other people were
so *very* kind as to send large documents ,  which i presume were actual
articles  ( about 1000 lines each )  ;  but i've stupidly deleted them
accidentally before having a chance even to skim them .   if they can
forgive me for my careless use of file-commands ,  would the original
senders be so kind as to resend ?  or anyone else who has good
crypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level ?  also , 
ftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about . 

yours ,  lulu .  .  .

then it was either _really_ good luck or you had some _very_ fast

to convert into each other ,  so you have to expect 2^54 trial encryptions
in the mean case ,  assuming known plaintext . 
2^54 / 2 /  ( 24*60*60 )  / 1000000 is ca .  104250 . 
so you must have managed to do 104250 encryptions per microsecond . 
ce infosys builds a very fast des chip that manages 2  (  !  )  encryptions
per microsecond . 

yes ,  i'm not very seriously bothered about the security of des yet ; 
though you might prefer to use triple des or idea ,  both of which
use more key bits .

nobody@alumni . cco . caltech . edu correctly states jerry berman's 1985 view on
privacy ,  but he mistakenly assumes that this represents berman's 1993 view as
eff executive director . 

as one of the people who convinced jerry that legal protections for privacy
are insufficient ,  and that technical measures ,  especially public key
cryptography ,  are also vitally necessary ,  i can tell you that jerry and eff
are fully committed to this position . 

the previous poster is apparently unaware of a long series of eff positions in
support of this view .   i suggest those interested read eff's position on
clipper or our other work in digital privacy .   check ftp . eff . org for more
details . 

one of the great things about human beings is that they are capable of change
and evolution in their thinking .   the idea that crypto is critical to privacy
is one which is no longer limited to certain net afficianados ,  but is 
spreading to parts of the public policy community in washington .

i can't answer all our questions in detail ,  but i can take a stab at
them . 

the form the operations that compute r1 ,  r2 ,  and r3 is ,  of course ,  the
famous ``triple encryption'' suggested for use with des .   it's much
stronger than a single encryption ,  and has an effective key length of
160 bits .   for reasons that were discussed when des was first
standardized ,  a simple double encryption would not have the same
strength .   triple encryption has been used by ibm since more or less
the beginning to encrypt other keys .   it's recommended for anything of
very high value .   and i think we can agree that the r_i and s_i fit
that description . 

why n_1 ,  n_2 ,  and n_3 ?   well ,  you need different plaintext values .   i
have no idea if they'll be disclosed or not .   at a guess ,  they're
constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible . 
a goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1-bit change
-- but the values of n in a series will have fairly similar bit
patterns ,  and there might ,  conceivably ,  be a weakness .   so the n_i
values are -- and i'm guessing -- chosen to increase the hamming
distance . 

in any event ,  i'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the s_i
from the u_i ,  let alone u .    ( observe :   if the nsa has u ,  they don't
need to find s_i .   but even if they do ,  they can't get u_1 and u_2 .   in
theory ,  they should never even see those values ,  even with a warrant .  ) 

the real question ,  i think ,  is why use this scheme at all ,  as opposed
to a hardware random number generator .   my answer is that this is
*much* more verifiable .   look -- suppose that nsa ,  nist ,  the aclu ,  the
eff ,  and the nra combined to build a *really* good random number
generator ,  and that it passed every test you could think of .   when you
come back next week to program some more chips ,  does it still work that
well ?   have any components changed in value ?   have the components been
changed out from under you ?   does it still work well the in the
presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards
selecting 1 bits ?   yes ,  you can run detailed statistical tests on it
again ,  but that's hard . 

consider ,  on the other hand ,  a software solution .   you bring your own
floppies with you ,  you can run cryptographic checksums ,  etc .   it's a
lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged ,  in other words . 
 ( yes ,  i can think of ways to cheat software ,  too .   i think that they're
a lot harder .  ) 

there are three issues with clipper .   the first is whether or not the
architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working .   my answer , 
with one significant exception ,  is yes .   i really do think that nsa and
nist have designed this scheme about as well as can be ,  assuming that
their real objectives are as stated :  to permit wiretapping ,  under
certain carefully-controlled circumstances ,  with a minimum risk of
abuse .    ( the exception is that u exists outside of the chip ,  on a
programming diskette .   that's seriously wrong .   u_1 and u_2 should be
loaded onto the chip separately .  )   to those who disagree  ( and i don't
claim my answer is obvious ,  though i found my own reasoning
sufficiently persuasive that i was forced to rewrite the conclusions
section of my technical analysis paper -- i had originally blasted the
scheme )  ,  i issue this invitation :   assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system ,  with complete regard for civil rights and
due process .   what would you do differently ?   in answering this
question ,  please accept nsa's fundamental assumptions :   that both
strong cryptography against outsiders ,  and the ability to wiretap
*some* domestic users ,  is necessary .    ( if you feel it necessary to
challenge those assumptions ,  do it in the context of the last issue i
present below .   right here ,  i'm discussing *just* the technical
aspects .   and no ,  i don't by any means claim that just because
something can be done ,  it should be .  ) 

the second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually
going to be used .   just because clipper chips are made this way doesn't
mean that that's the only way they'll be made .   maybe the nsa will
substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the
shipping dock .   and they'll generate bogus warrant requests ,  so that
the escrow agents don't wonder why they've never called .    ( ``sorry , 
guys ;  all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have
bought triple-des phones instead .   who'd 'a' thunk it ? '' )   i have no
answer to this question ,  and at the moment ,  i don't see a way of
answering it .   those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer
to the final question ,  below . 

the third ,  and most serious issue ,  is whether or not clipper is a good
idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law . 
i think that the answer is no ,  but it's not a no-brainer .   i'm a civil
libertarian ,  not a libertarian ,  for reasons that i explained at great
length on the net in the elder days ,  and that i don't have the energy
to repeat now .   but that means that i'm willing to accept that some
laws are necessary ,  so long as they respect the essential rights of
individuals .   the government already has the ability and -- in our
system -- the right to issue search warrants ,  and while that power has
certainly been abused ,  it's also been used quite properly and fairly in
other cases .   is key escrow sufficiently different ?   i think so -- but
again ,  it's not an easy question for me .    ( it is easy for libertarians
to answer ,  of course ,  since clipper is completely alien to much of the
rest of their  ( oft-admirable )  philosophy .   and it's also easy for those
who give their unreserved trust to government ,  a group i'm much more
distant from .  )

iff the phones transmit their serial nos .  as part of the message then what
is to say that each phone can take that serial number and use it to generate

don alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to
comp . risks .   i'll present my variant on it instead ,  since i feel it's a
bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat .   depends on the
protocol that's followed for reading traffic .   briefly ,  the cops get a
wiretap warrant ,  and record the call .   they then notice the encryption
and the disclosure header .   it ,  along with a copy of their warrant ,  is
sent to the fbi ,  or whoever it is who holds the family key .   the
f-holder decrypts the header ,  and sends the serial number n and the
encrypted session key u[k] to the escrow agents .   they ,  in turn ,  use u1
and u2 to recover k ,  and send that to the local police . 

note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever .   neither the
cops nor the fbi ever see u ,  so they can't read other traffic .   every
request must be validated by both the fbi and the escrow agents .   the
cops and the fbi together can't cheat ,  since they don't have u .    ( i
regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the
system .   it's to prevent this that i modified alvarez's scheme .  )   the
escrow agents can't read the conversation ,  since they don't have it ; 
all they have is n and u[k] .   and the police don't even see n . 

it's harder to see how to block decryption of old ,  warrantless , 
wiretaps .   there is one protection -- you have to persuade the escrow
agents that the call is current .   but that's not nearly as strong . 
there are approaches i can see that might work ,  involving sequences of
data on an unalterable medium ,  complete with cryptographic protection
against insertion onto a new medium .   but i don't have anything yet
that isn't too complex for comfort ,  or too hard to install in the real
world .   the nsa might have an answer ;  they may or may not be smarter
than me ,  but i've been working on this for a week ,  and they've had years .

subject :  re :  clipper considered harmful [restated and amplified]


brad yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a
phone-clipper relationship . 

it doesn't wash . 

recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect's phone
calls .  they do what they do now--figure out which lines to tap .  they then
record the stuff .  if it's clipper ,  they read the law enforcement block , 
extract the serial number ,  and get the keys using the court order . 

no new difficulties  ( such as using someone else's phone instrument or phone
line )  are introduced that wouldn't have existed absent clipper .  if the
crooks were going to use a pay phone  ( say )  ,  they could have done so without
clipper .  if the government figures out they're so doing ,  they listen in ,  and
if it's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys . 

if the crooks use an innocent person's clipper phone on the tapped line
there's no problem .  the feds don't care whose phone instrument is used ,  just
that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line .  they get the
serial number ,  get the keys ,  and they are in business . 

no clipper chip to person association is ever needed .

though i think this an overstatement ,  it does contain a grain of truth .  it's

subject :  back doors in clipper ? 


i think it very unlikely there are back doors in clipper ,  for two reasons : 

1 .  the government doesn't need them if it can get the key  ( and yes ,  i assume
that the  " official "  government obeys court orders ,  etc . --and that the design
of the chip and its approval were  " official "  )  ; 

2 .  it would defeat the whole purpose of providing secure crypto for american
business that couldn't be read by our economic adversaries .  if this were not
a legitimate and genuine purpose ,  and as many think ,  the nsa can read des , 
why bother otherwise ? 

rational responses preferred to conspiracy theories ,  thanks .

two safeguards : 

1 .  the fbi could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow
agencies ,  and associate it with a particular court order ; 

2 .  if the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue
closely .  it is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal
wiretap is the person the court order covered . 

putting it another way ,  this question is not very different from the
pre-clipper question  " what's to prevent the fbi from getting a court order
to tap al capone and then using it to tap jonathan livingstone seagull
instead ?  "

doesn't matter if we assume they are obeying the law ,  since they won't have
had a court order to tap calls prior to the date of the court order ,  and
thus won't have them available . 

if they aren't obeying the law ,  we are in an entirely different discussion , 
in which this is the least of one's worries .

   it was implied in the first technical posting by dorothy denning that the
fbi would do the decryption *for* the law enforcement agencies .   it wasn't
clear to me from the post whether this would be done in realtime or not ,  or
whether the fbi would just decrypt the session keys for the locals ,  or would
do the whole message . 
 
   one thing i'm a bit puzzled by :   why aren't they doing this with a public
key scheme of some sort ?   you could generate two uniqe public/private pairsor
for each chip .   then ,  escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies .   set
the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys .   to decrypt
a message ,  both escrow agencies  ( in the right order ,  for most pk schemes ) 
have to decrypt with the escrowed private key .   this way ,  there wouldn't be
thecconcern that ,  once the police had asked fo  a warrant/wiretap ,  they
would have your key forver .

subject :  re :  clipper considered harmful

steve bellovin writes a well-thought-out and nearly persuasive article about
why the clipper  ( are we still calling it clipper today ,  or have they figured
out a non-infringing word yet ?  )  protocol is almost as good as one can do
given their marching ordes . 

in article <1993apr24 . 160121 . 17189@ulysses . att . com> smb@research . att . com  ( steven bellovin )  writes :

i'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument .   in my
view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is
secret ,  leading to suspicion that there is a back door .   without complete
disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled ,  no matter how many trusted
experts are allowed to look at it in isolation . 

is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm ?   the only
concern i've seen with making skipjack public is that someone could build
clipperphones without registering the keys .   assume f can really be kept
secret as the government assumes .   then as part of the initial connection , 
a clipperphone executes a protocol with the pseudophone to demonstrate
that they both know f .   for example ,  the initiating phone picks a number q
and sends e[q ;  f] .   the receiver sends back e[q+1 ;  f] ,  and the initiator
sends back e[q+2 ;  f] to demonstrate that her first packet wasn't just a
random 64-bit block .   repeat in the opposite direction with another q so
it can't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential
numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial
numbers of subsequent challenges .   this way clipperphones will talk only
to other clipperphones .   of course the pseudo company can build their own
proprietary skipjack phone ,  but the presidential fact sheet implies that
they won't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow . 

what's wrong with this picture ?   it depends of f staying secret and on
skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis ,  but the government appears to
believe in both of these .   even if the particular q&a i suggest has some
flaw ,  i imagine there's a zero-knowledge-proof protocol that doesn't . 

smb says :

agreed .   my view ,  and you can quote me :  if it's not worth doing ,  it's

subject :  how to escrow ,  if escrowing were ok

  there is a description of something called a  " fair crypto system "  in the
may 1993 issue of byte ,  p .  134 ,  attributed to mit professor silvio micali . 

  the way it works is as follows : 

  you generate your private key s ,  and break it up into pieces s1 ,  s2 ,  s3 , 
s4 ,  and s5 ,  such that  ( s1 + s2 +  .  .  .  + s5 )  mod p = s . 
  you give each piece s1 ,  s2 ,  etc .  to a different escrow agency . 
  the agencies each compute g^sn mod p ,  and forward the result to the public
key telephone book keeper . 
  the public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g^sn mod p ,  reduces
the result to mod p ,  and this will be the user's public key . 

  now ,  if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies ,  and the user
could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted ,  the result would
be something of an improvement over the proposed clipper system . 

  i still don't think key escrow is a good idea ,  for both philosophical and
security reasons ,  but i do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether
escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good
faith ,  or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected
for spinelessness in the face of official requests .

  so ,  you admit that clipper opens the doors wide for the following scenario : 

  feds :  we need the keys to joe blow's phone . 

  escrow agent :  joe blow ?   you have a warrant to tap his line ? 

  feds :  well ,  no ,  but we have a warrant to tap carlos  " slime-devil "  gonzales'
     line ,  and our tap shows that mr .  gonzales is using mr .  blow's phone . 

  escrow agent :  well ,  ok .  .  .  .

>no clipper chip to person association is ever needed . 

yeah ,  but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested
mistakenly and has their life turned upside-down because some law
enforcement agency *does* make a chip :  : person association ? 

i wonder if there are any plans to keep these records  ( e . g .  encode the
serial number into the upc scanned at k-mart along with the credit
card info ,  voila .  ) 

at least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or
whatever  ( i . e .  to be coming from your telephone number the person
likely is in your house etc .  )  ,  plus or minus some shenanigans of
course . 

but i'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id ,  recording
the conversation ,  then doing a quick cross-lookup and your name comes
up as owner of that id  ( mistakenly ,  maybe you sold the phone at a
garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever .  )  they
might only know who one side of the conversation is ,  for example . 

anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross-correlate such
databases loses two points .  first ,  law enforcement agencies can of
course do this .  second ,  they're only forbidden from budgeting any
money for it .  the irs ,  for example ,  does do this anyhow .  they just
don't spend any money on it so it's  ( technically )  legal i guess . 

instead they probably trade little favors with companies like
mastercard  ( if you're the irs i'll bet you have a *lot* of
opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases .  ) 

i know ,  an irs guy read an amazing list off to me  ( from his screen ,  i
could hear him typing to pull up each screen )  once on the phone during
a dispute i had with them  ( to intimidate me ,  actually ,  not much of a
dispute ,  i didn't particularly disagree ,  but for some reason this
fellow wanted to play tough guy with me ,  i hope he's better now .  ) 

amazing stuff he had at his finger tips .  be afraid .

it is completely clear .  you have to assume that each byte that was encrypted
by this 'clipper chip' has been compromised .  
some people wondered ,  why denning ,  hellman and others did not respond ,

the shannon limit for voice lines is likely somewhere around 25kbps . 
we are rapidly approaching it .  the fastest affordable full-duplex
modems currently on the market are v32bis ,  which is 14400bps . 

>how far can voice be compressed ? 

celp manages to sound decent at 4800 bps . 

in theory ,  if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice
into ascii ,  and a perfect synthesis system on the other end that
sounded just like the person you were speaking to ,  you could get it
down to the information content of the speech . 

with various kinds of lpc ,  you can get it down to 2400 bps or prehaps
even less ,  at which point it sounds horrible . 

4800 bps is more than adequite for our purposes .

true ,  but the basic idea behind any communications security system is not
to absolutely deny access ,  but to make access more expensive  ( in time , 
money ,  manpower )  than it is worth .

david , 

   neither  ( 1 )  or  ( 2 )  apply with the government ,  though .  the feds ,  unlike
apple ,  have repeatedly demonstrated that trust is an unsafe thread on which
to hang your freedom .  why ?   because unlike apple in  ( 2 )  ,  the govt has no
credibility to lose .  i'm serious about this .  one can name just about any
agency -- the irs ,  rtc ,  fcc ,  faa ,  fbi ,  nsa ,  cia -- and find numerous examples
of the public trust run roughshod over .  worse ,  one can rarely find in such 
examples any serious consequences to the offending agency .  even supposing
we could get a reign on trust somehow ,  there's always the matter of competence
in govt agencies .  can they even trust themselves ? 

  -mel

  p . s .  i was amused when you mentioned the usda as an example of an agency
capable of managing the an escrow .  i'm a consultant to the usda ,  and while those
*i* work with are wonderful <grin> ,  the agency itself is ranked in industry
publications such as govt computer news as one of the worst caretakers of
its computer resources .  recently ,  prime time live did a long segment on
the usda's computer troubles .  they are making a concerted effort to change , 
but intentions don't make a track record .

no no no no no no no . 

it will go like this : 

feds :  we need the key to phone 334re67d99 . 

escrow :  you have a warrant to tap the line phone 334re67d99 is on ? 

feds :  yes . 

escrow :  fine ,  here is our key . 

what happens is ,  feds tap a line ;  find clipper is being used ;  extract
serial number ;  get key ;  decipher convo .   the serial number is never
registered to a specific owner ,  it is _sent_ as part of the
conversation .   if i give you my clipper phone ,  you do not need to
re-register it  ( mainly because it was never 'registered' to me in the
first place )  . 

there are a lot of things that bother me about clipper ,  but this is
not one of them .   let's get our facts straight and not waste effort
demolishing straw men .

as i read the current wiretap law ,  it would not be legal now .   on the
other hand ,  assuming a legislative change ,  recording but not decrypting
clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the supreme
court ,  using the same reasoning  ( or the lack thereof .  .  .  )  by which they
permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers . 

incidentally ,  if we use that as our model ,  the court will likely not
uphold selective recording .    ( on the other hand ,  i don't think they've
thrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet .   must be that exception to
the fourth amendment that i can never find in my copy of the bill of
rights .  ) 

a lot -- and i mean a *lot* -- will depend on exactly how clippertaps
 ( or tipperclaps ,  for encrypted music ?  )  are used .   don alvarez showed in
the latest risks digest that it's possible to prevent the cops from
reading traffic after their warrant expires . 

that is -- the cops send the lef to the f-holder .   the f-holder strips
off f ,  and sends u[k] , n to the escrow agents .   they send either u or k
to the cops .    ( don says u ,  i say k .  )   the cops can't use u in the
future ,  because they can't strip off f .   the f-holder never sees u .   in
don's model ,  the escrow agents can't read the traffic ,  because they
don't have k ;  in my model ,  they have k ,  but not the message itself . 
and i trust that more because i think the cops and the fbi  ( the
f-holder )  are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules .   the
net result is that by involving the f-holder and the escrow agents on

david , 

  while i disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government , 
i think you have a good idea here .  there is danger that ,  with funding coming
from asset forfeitures ,  the government could continue to promulgate a bad
product in spite of poor acceptance .  making the product pay its way  ( as
it must for private ventures )  would be a good incentive for quality and
listening to we ,  the ranters .   :  )

another idea :  use a laptop computer .   as mentioned earlier ,  the lcd screen
is a lot less noisy than a standard crt ,  but since many laptops have power
supplies that run at 3 volts instead of 5 ,  they would be considerably 
quieter .

the whole point of the escrow system is to prevent the fbi from making 
illegal wiretaps .  why not have the fbi holds the
keys and that's it ?  why do we need the escrow system at all ? 

unless a 3rd party  ( a judge )  verifies that the requested serial number
is  " right "  ,  and the fbi can get any key they like at anytime ,  the escrow
system is useless .

well ,  lets for a hypothetical put our selves in the place of the us end

would also let them know via the 'other' channels that a )  their income is about
to take a hit ,  and b )  their health may not be too good either .

the problem is that this will also cause   " a certain amount of interference " 
in *all* systems within the range of the device .   a long time ago i built a
small jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at 
something like 4am ,  which had just enough range to cover my room and his . 
however something powerful enough to mask all  ( or at least most )  emissions from
your computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods
radio and tv reception .   this isn't going to make you many friends . 

incidentally ,  an older-model trs80 makes a fine wideband jammer <grin>

   it's not clipper ,  it's any encryption system .   i've seen a number of
   designs ;  they generally involve a multi-line cleartext bridge . 

depending on the encryption system ,  so long as everyone has the same
key ,  it can be done .   for example ,  i was using  " vat "  ,  which is an
internet audio tool ,  for a conference call ,  and we were encrypting the
session .    ( unfortunately ,  one site was doing more work ,  and didn't
have the cpu for it ,  so it didn't sound all that good at a different
site ) 

so ,  you don't neccessarily have to have a clear-text bridge .   but if
you do ,  its totally internal to one of the sites involved in the
conversation .  .  .  .

i tried this code yesterday .   on my sparcstation elc it takes over
300 seconds to compress 22 seconds' worth of speech .   this means that it
needs to be  " optimized "  by over a factor of 10 before it will be usable
in even a half-duplex mode . 

i question whether celp is the best approach for this application .   it produces
great compression but at the expense of tremendous cpu loads .   we want
something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high-end pc's
without dsp cards .   my guess is that some other algorithm is going to be
a better starting point .

my interpretation of denning's description is that s1 and s2 are chosen
randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300-
chip programming session .   i imagine that the chips are in a carrier which
will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly - there would not be
a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little pla programmer as some
people have envisioned . 

my guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the
s1 and s2 using a specified algorithm provides an  ( in-principle )  checkable
way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers
used to generate the keys .   since we have to trust the escrow companies
anyway ,  it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from
random seeds entered by the escrow agents .   and since the algorithm for
key-generation is public  ( modulo skipjack secrecy )  then in principle an
agent could challenge the procedure ,  ask for s1 and s2 to be exposed ,  and
run his own independent calculation of u1 and u2 to verify that that is
what is actually being put onto the floppies . 

and yes ,  there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could
be hard to check .   the laptop probably will not really be destroyed each
time .   hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the s1 and s2 entered by
the trusted escrow agents .   back doors in the chip could allow u to be
recovered .   heck ,  each chip could be recorded with the same u ,  ignoring
what was on the floppy .

       the classic comment on new encryption algorithms comes from
friedman : 

	 " no new cypher is worth considering unless it comes 
	from someone who has already broken a very hard one .  " 

historically ,  friedman has been right .   it's really hard to develop
a good cypher .   ibm's lucifer ,  the precursor to des ,  turns out to have
been fatally flawed .   most of the des-like systems other than des seem
to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis .   the first two tries at
public key encryption  ( remember knapsack cyphers ?  )  were broken .   most
if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were
broken eventually .   attempts in the computer era to home-brew encryption
have been disappointing ;  the classic  " a survey of data insecurity packages " 
in cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the
popular  " security packages "  of the late 1980s . 

        a new ,  proprietary algorithm ?   no way . 

        if the us is permitting general export of this thing ,  it has
to be weak ;  that's how the current regulations work .   currently there's
a willingness to allow systems with short keys  ( 32 bits appears to be
no problem ;  the 56 bits of des are too many )  or weak algorithms
 ( i think word perfect qualifies under that rule )  to be exported . 
i can't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the 
pto and the state department's arms control division without finding that out . 

					john nagle

p . s .  no ,  i'm not thrilled with clipper either ,  but that's a different issue .

yes .   i'm not sure if my xposting to comp . speech made it to here too ,  but
i've found that a low sample rate  ( 3300 samples/sec at 8 bits per sample ) 
plus the pd 'shorten' lossless sound compression code actually does get
speech into 14 . 4k with a simdgen left over .   this is *definitely* worth
working on ,  folks .   and shorten works in well under real-time .

i've been reading this board passively for a while now and find the
subject absolutely fascinating ,  especially from the point of view of
a civil rights nut like myself .   my problem is that i'm new to the field
and paragraphs like the above keep popping up .   i'm sure what mr .  
bellovin is writing about is both fascinating and important ,  but i have 
no idea what it means .    : - )    
  
  anyway i'm keen to learn and will read anything i can get my hands on
that explains this stuff in lay terms  ( i have a decent cs background ,  but
not a huge amount of hyper-advanced math )  .   can anyone point me to a faq
or a decent source of information about the guts of current cryptography and
maybe a little history as well ?   i read the piece in this month's wired ,  can
anyone tell me how much i should trust the references they suggest ? 

  thanks in advance , 
   steve .

i did .   you're mistaken .   nsa's communications intelligence mission is
strictly against foreign governments .   here's an excerpt from the enabling
charter  ( 24 oct 52 ,  truman )  that should clarify this .   the charter was
declassified in about feb 1990 when an foia request made it public .   mind
you ,  i don't know that they never collect anything they're not supposed
to .  .  .  but spying on us citizens isn't in their charter . 

    b .  the comint  mission of the national  security agency
	 ( nsa )  shall be to provide an effective ,   unified organization
	and control of the communications  intelligence activities of
	the united states  conducted against foreign  governments ,  to
	provide for  integrated operational  policies and  procedures
	pertaining thereto .    as  used in  this directive ,   the terms
	 " communications intelligence "   or  " comint "  shall be construed
	to mean all  procedures and methods used in  the interception
	of communications  other  than foreign  press and  propaganda
	broadcasts  and  the  obtaining  of   information  from  such
	communications by other  than intended recipients ,   but shall
	exclude censorship  and the  production and dissemination  of
	finished intelligence . 

they're also tasked with protecting the us's communications ,  but i haven't
seen the specific enabling memo on that .   i assume that's the role under
which skipjack was developed . 

nsa is not in the standard-setting business ,  though -- that's why this
clipper stuff came from nist ,  which i believe is tasked with coming up
with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies , 
which would include nsa .

	i don't think that this should be worked on just in the context
of cryptography .  that's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts
of people . 

	what's needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone
quality speech<->rs232 converter .  imagine ,  if you will ,  a little box that
takes data on its serial port and puts out sound ,  and takes sound and codes
it to signals on its serial port .  full duplex .  now ,  this device is not a
cryptographic device .  it's a portable poor man's sound blaster or whatever
you want to call it .  it's got loads of perfectly legitimate applications
for : 
	a )  speech synthesis  ( with a few nifty libraries and some samples ) 
	b )  speech recording for electronic messaging
	c )  building voicemail systems
	d )  internet talk radio
	e )  internet relay chat

	of course ,  some of the electronic messaging in item b might be
encrypted ,  possibly realtime ,  but that's the user's decision .  one would
need 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout
to switch over ,  and some code on ,  say ,  a 486 laptop . 

	i'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
internet talk radio could be done .  ideally ,  though ,  it should be a general
purpose device .  it should be a general purpose enough device that nobody
should be able to balk at its widespread use .  obviously ,  to make it easy
for homebrewers ,  it should use pretty common hardware . 

	it's interesting to note that i'd already talked with a couple
of folks about building such a thing ,  before this whole clipper thing
started .  i even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are
able to make sample units ,  given incentive and some time .  i'd envisioned
finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund
development of a public domain board layout and parts set ,  that could
be published in the form of cad drawings for a couple of major cad
packages ,  and in postscript . 

	anyone interested ?  i'll start a provisional mailing list .  let
me know if you want on .

okay ,  it looks like i am going to have to do the history lesson after all . 

during the vietnam war ,  there were a great many citizens opposed to it
who considered themselves perfectly law abiding ,  although mr .  nixon and
his lackeys thought otherwise . 

the federal government had no compunction about adding  " people who
are otherwise decent ,  law abiding and upstanding ,  but disagree with
us "  to your nice little list .  do you think this could never happen
again ? 

note that i am not speculating about what the government could do , 
but discussing the sort of  " observation "  - including but not limited
to phone tapping - that the government put its citizens under during
a time of national tension . 

your naivete is still appalling ,  btw .  i mean ,  read what you posted again . 
how are we to differentiate between good people and bad people ?  answer : 
a priori ,  we can't ;  we have to assume .  now ,  which way do we assume ?  do
we assume a priori that a citizen is law-abiding ,  or rather a potential

supposedly great about america is the freedoms enjoyed by citizens who
are presumed to be law-abiding until proven otherwise .

nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy . 

how come the media is not telling about the provisions of the clipper
decision ?   the provisions of the crime bill ?   the abuses of civil forfeiture ? 
the government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want
gun bans ,  etc .  ,  yet the same pollsters have determined  ( according to
the media )  that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the holocaust
is .  .  . 

the people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are
denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of
rights are going on quietly .   when they find out  ( when it hits them )  , 
it will be too late .   one cannot expect each citizen to spend all their
time probing ,  searching ,  researching ,  etc .    for example ,  how big a
percentage of the average population even has access to usenet ?   way
less than 1 percent ,  i bet .    how many outside of internet/usenet

>ouch !   thanks for trying it . 

the following program is a very quick hack i created a few months
ago to determine whether a sun sparcstation ipc could perform
real-time ,  full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates
sustainable by today's modems . 

this test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device , 
compresses it with gsm 06 . 10  ( compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples
recorded at 8khz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 hz frame rate )  ,  encrypts
it with des ,  then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio
back to the audio device .   the compressed ,  encrypted audio stream
is 13 kbits/s  (  !  )  . 

my sparcstation ipc  ( not exactly a very fast machine these days , 
certainly slower than an elc )  would just barely sustain this activity
 ( audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible )  .   i
ran it as a real-time process to get the best results .   remember , 
though ,  that this program is a quick hack and the performance can
certainly be improved . 

the audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub . cs . tu-berlin . de , 
i believe  ( look for gsm or toast )  .   i used eric young's des
implementation but i no longer know where i got it from .

the medis isn't 'is' .   the media 'are' .   'media' means 'more than one
medium . '  there are thousands of publications .   some say this ,  some say
that .   

     how can the bulk of the people be informed ,  when they won't read
     informative publications ?

subject :  hearing on 29 april 1993

i received a fax of a letter from representative markey  ( subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance )  to ron brown  ( secretary of commerce )  .   since 
encryption and the clipper chip are raised in this letter ,  i felt it would be
of interest .   i understand that on 29 april ,  mr .  markey will be holding a
hearing on the questions raised in this letter .   there may also be a follow-on
hearing dedicated to the clipper chip ,  but that's not definite . 

i've typed in the letter ,  which follows .   any errors in transcription are

------------------ letter of interest follows ----------------

april 19 ,  1993

the honorable ronald h .  brown
secretary
department of commerce
14th and pennsylvania ave .  ,  nw
washington ,  dc 20236

dear secretary brown : 

   as you know ,  i have long been interested in the privacy 
and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in 
a networked environment .   recent reports concerning the 
administration's endorsement of an electronic encryption 
standard ,  based upon  " clipper chip "  technology ,  have raised a 
number of related issues .   the international competitiveness 
of u . s .  high tech manufacturers and the software industry is 
a key factor that the government should consider when 
addressing issues of encryption and data security .   as the 
nation moves forward in developing the national 
communications and information infrastructure ,  security of 
telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an 
increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of 
users . 

   the  " hacker "  community can compromise the integrity of 
telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the 
network .   the people and businesses that use the nation's 
telecommunications network and the personal computers linked 
through it increasingly are demanding that information be 
protected against unauthorized access ,  alteration ,  and theft . 

   i am concerned that the administration's plan may mean 
that to remain competitive internationally ,  u . s .  companies 
would be compelled to develop two products -- one for u . s .  
government customers ,  and another for private ,  commercial 
users who may want a higher encryption standard .   this may 
inadvertently increase costs to those u . s .  companies hoping 
to serve both markets .   to assist the subcommittee's analysis 
of this issue ,  please respond to the following questions : 

1 .  has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the 
administration been tested by any entity other than nsa ,  nist 
or the vendor ?   if so ,  please identify such entities and the 
nature of testing performed .   if not ,  please describe any 
plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how 
such experts will be chosen . 

2 .  under the administration's plan ,  what entities will be the 
holders of the  " keys "  to decrypt scrambled data ?   what 
procedures or criteria will the administration utilize to 
designate such key holders ? 

3 .  does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the 
administration contain a  " trap door "  or  " back door ,  "  which 
could allow an agency or entity of the federal government to 
crack the code ? 

4 .  it is clear that over time ,  changes in technologies used 
for communications will require new techniques and additional 
equipment .   how will encryption devices adapt to the rapid 
advancement of telecommunications technology ? 

5 .  what additional costs would the proposed encryption place 
on the federal government ?   what is the estimated cost to 
consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard 
in their equipment ? 

6 .  what is the commerce department's assessment of the 
competitive impact of the administration's endorsement of the 
 " clipper chip "  technology on u . s .  exports of computer and 
telecommunications hardware and software products ? 

   i would appreciate your response by no later than close-
of-business ,  wednesday ,  april 28 ,  1993 .   if you have any 
questions ,  please have your staff contact colin crowell or 
karen colannino of the subcommittee staff at  ( 202 )  226-2424 . 

sincerely , 

edward j .  markey
chairman

subject :  implementing a diffie-hellman key exchange . 


i want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper
level routines into a single data link .  the upper levels won't know
about this ,  and thus key exchange shall only need to occur once  ( at
the initial link establishment )  .  i figure that i can do this with
des and a diffie-hellman key exchange . 

is using a diffie-hellman exchange to establish a 64 bit des key
acceptable ,  in other words ,  what are the pro's and con's of such a 
setup ?  are there any important issues to watch out for  ( aside from
filtering out unacceptable keys )  ? 

and in order to achieve this ,  i guess i will need to use 64bit math
routines  ( for probable prime number calculation ,  exponentiation etc )  , 
so could someone point me towards a good package  ( this is strictly
non-commercial )  .

     why don't we move down even further toward the masses by setting this
up on an ibm pc clone ( probably needs to be a 386 or a 486 )  with a 
sound blaster and a v . 32bis modem .   those components are very widely
available .   i don't know if the pc has enough horsepower to encrypt the data
at realtime ,  but the sound blaster has 4 to 1 hardware compression and will
work at any sampling rate from 4khz to 23 khz .

glenn , 

thanks for posting that .   i was surprised to notice ,  however ,  that one
question i might have expected to be asked was not :    " are all forms of
strong encryption other than the clipper to be made illegal ?  "   speaking
of which ,  is anyone aware of whether that question *has* been asked of
any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government ?   i have
not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been
reported ,  but i could have easily missed it .

    the nsa's charter forbids them from doing any purely domestic
intelligence work ,  i would think that even providing assistance in
development of the skipjack algorithom is a violation of that charter .  
but as with any intrenched government agency ,  they will do what they
think is expedent .

interesting !   where can i get the whole thing ? 

   nsa is not in the standard-setting business ,  though -- that's why this
   clipper stuff came from nist ,  which i believe is tasked with coming up
   with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies , 
   which would include nsa . 

several of the newspaper reports have made it fairly clear that the
nsa did all the real work .   you can't believe everything you read in
the papers  : - )  ,  but the package of information the nist is faxing out
has so little information beyond what's widely known that it sounds

i found the personal attacks on prof .  denning pretty disgusting . 
i don't agree with all her positions ;  but i think scholars can
disagree without the argument getting into the gutter . 

if these personal attacks are what stopped prof .  denning from
replying on issues of substance ,  they have cause real harm
to the serious debate here .

here is how !  lets write a document which includes all the reasons

everyone of you to take the  ( very simple )   " start "  below and repost it

[all of these are points - which should be made into paragraphs]

what is wrong with the clipper chip - by usenet users
-----------------------------------------------------

1 )  it is secret .  
2 )  how can we trust the escrow agencies ? 
3 )  it is not cost-effective
4 )  we want other encryption systems ,  the government seems to want to
   disallow it in the future
5 )  anyone can build a non-key system
6 )  we are worried about a back door
7 )  once everyone uses a clipper chip ,  the mechanism for a big-brother
   government is in place ,  a change of government can lead to it .  
   especially since the escrow agencies operation is not governed by
   law  ( so the president can change the rules to allow free access to
   the keys at any time ,  e . g .  ,  during war ) 
8 )  few criminals are caught by wiretaps ,  the cost [and risks] are unjustified
9 )  once the fbi get hold of a key ,  it can decrypt past and future conversations

        and just were would you put that bridge ?   if it isn't at one of

this doesn't work ,  due to the near-field far-field effect .  you may stop
someone five yards away from listening in ,  but someone fifty yards away will
be relatively unaffected - unless you pump out hundreds of watts and jam all 
the neighbourhood tv's as well .  in that case the government will stomp on you -
ask any radio ham !  democratic governments care even more about their voters' 
right to watch soap operas than they do about national security ,  and dictators 
consider their propaganda to be an integral part of their national security .

i'm afraid this doesn't work either .  we can pick up laptop screens without any
problem . 

most of the so-called `low radiation' monitors are also useless .  the description
turns out to a marketing assertion rather than an engineering one . 

we thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military tempest kit ,  but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers .  we built a prototype ,  it works , 
and it's still sitting on my lab bench .  commercial interest was exactly zero . 

in the absence of open standards ,  a monitor which really is `low radiation'
 ( and costs 500 dollars more )  can't compete against a monitor which just
claims to be `low radiation'  ( and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box )  .

we had a senior nsa scientist in cambridge at one of our workshops recently
 ( in fact he was here when the clipper announcement was made ,  but we didn't
learn of it till after he'd gone )  .  he said on this point that he was forbidden
by law to monitor conversations between us nationals  ( and he is a chap who is 
very precise about his choice of words )  .  so i don't expect he'd have any qualms
about monitoring a domestic us conversation if one of the parties was an alien .

in 1967 ,  when i was a grad student at uw in seattle i had a chance to 
read hoover's book  " masters of deceit "  ,  and i quote a sentence  ( from 
memory )  : 

 " and beware my fellow americans ,  a communist may look just as an 
ordinary person .  .  .  " 

i went to the mirror and it was true .

i cannot believe you can make these claims given hard evidence of
abuse .   do you ignore stories about survellience of martin luther
king ,  have you blocked from your mind mccarthy's crusade in the 50's ?

and how many illegal wiretaps are performed ?   funny ,  but i'll be that
the fbi doesn't keep statistics on these !

there are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject .   for
example ,  the national computer security act of 1987 specifically directs
nbs [sic] to work with nsa on developing security standards for civilian
federal computers .    ( pick up the bill from cpsr . org ;  it also includes
a report describing it ,  and some of the legislative history ,  including
concerns about nsa's involvement .  )   note also that nsa is specifically
charged with running the national computer security center ,   -- to
quote the aforementioned report -- ``nsa also will work with industries at
the dod computer security center to develop security standards for private
sector use . ''

it may or may not be a good idea to have nsa tinkering with this ,  but
i'm pretty sure it's legal .    ( btw -- when it comes to development of
cryptosystems ,  there may be two choices .   either nsa helped develop it , 
in which case maybe they can crack it ,  maybe not ,  but probably ,  no one
else can ;  or nsa didn't help ,  in which case they probably can crack it , 
and maybe others as well .  .  .  )

motorola certainly makes them ,  but i don't know how you

of our secure radios .   

you could also bring in encryption chips from outside the country .

it depends on the mode you're using .   for a single 64-bit input block ,  a
one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits - in other words ,  it essentially turns the output block into
a random number .   if you're encrypting data in cbc mode ,  however ,  only the
one 64-bit block will be affected .   the next block ,  and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly . 

it's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely .

    maybe you are using the wrong amendment .   if someone were to seize
a safe containing your  ( paper )  records ,  and demand that you produce
the combination ,  the applicable defense would be on grounds of
unreasonable search and seizure .   the police would be entitled to
subpoena documents relating to a specific matter ,  but any broad search
such as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional . 
in the case of the safe ,  they would probably get a locksmith and
assert that they only examined documents covered by the warrent . 
 ( sure !  )   in the cryptographic case ,  their only resort would be
rubber-hose cryptography . 

     ( this would also make a good  " mental experiment "  to use in
choosing escrow agents .   would you trust this proposed agent with a
key to your hard disk ? --or half the key for that matter .  )

suppose instead that s1 and s2 can be reconstructed given 3 or 4 of the
unit keys generated in a single batch  ( through some sort of known
plaintext attack ,  say )  .   suppose further that 3 or 4 of the chips
programmed in each session never find their way into commercial
products ,  but instead end up  " elsewhere "  . 

suppose the folks at  " elsewhere "  can determine a unit key ,  given
physical access to one of these chips .   then those same folks can
determine s1 and s2 for the whole batch .  .  . 

too many suppositions ?   yeah ,  probably .

         is it realistic for the government to try to keep the details

you would have to use something other than the at&t black box - in other

please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality
of other strong cryptosystems .    so far any references i have seen
have been weasel-words  (  " more plans in the future ,  etc "  )  ,  but nothing
that could be taken as a  " no  ( strong crypto will not be outlawed )  "  .   i
have heard  ( not verified )  that the crime bill before congress has
language that either requires escrow of keys ,  or that will regard
all systems 'unapproved' for public use ,  like strong cryptosystems
not trivially broken by the govt ,  or without escrowed keys
which one cannot readily change  ( read :  use being only permitted by
folks with 'special' connections ,  or government agencies )  as either
'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools' .   not outlawed specifically
but by added civil forfeiture powers ,  and clever wording ,  effectively
outlawed for all intents and purposes . 

now ,  for some idle speculation  .  .  .  for those who don't care ,  hit 'n' now . 

crypto being effectively outlawed could be done without specifically
outlawing any class of crypto systems .   for example ,  a crowbar ,  hammers , 
screwdrivers ,  and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much
at the whim of the authorities ,  based primarily on the individual
possessing them in the car ,  etc .  not being in a trade that makes routine
use of these tools .   in a like manner ,  one who has no 'legitimate need'
 ( gov't definition )  for strong crypto software or systems ,  and is caught
using them ,  might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools' . 
in other words ,  if one is not working for a corporation with extremely
sensitive commercial data that warrants  ( in the fed's opinion )  strong
security ,  or a government agency ,  and securing only work-related data , 
not personal data ,  one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd . 
a personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as
a 'legitimate need' :  
 " why do you want such strong security ,  especially from 'legitimate law
enforcement' ?  an individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so
concerned - government is not in the business of revealing your personal
secrets to the public .  .  .  so you must be trying to conceal or planning
to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity .  .  .   do you have something
to hide ,  hmmmm ?  " 
i expect that initially there will be some people selected either at
random ,  or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of
'making an example' for those who think the feds are not serious about
this .  .  .   ( mega ' : - ( 's ) 

one asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that
there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out as such  ( an
argument used in the abortion debate )  :    " you do not have a right to have
security that 'legitimate law enforcement cannot break' "   ( as suggested
in the clipper press release )  . 

this ,  in a nutshell ,  is what i find so extremely frightening .   not only
for crypto systems ,  as in this case ,  but for the precident it will set , 
laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy  ( escrow of both
safe-deposit box keys - 'master' keys or combinations for privately
owned safes ,  and so on .   why not ?  )  .  .  . 

i cannot think of a better way to make an 'end-run' around those
'inconvenient' parts of the us constitution .   a law cannot be easily
declared unconstitutional ,  if it there is no specific law .   it would
simply be a minor extension of the rico statutes or wod policies .  a
simple policy decision ,  just like so many of the gun regulations are
mainly batf policy decisions .  .  .   the conversation of the fed agents
would go something like : 

 " we are gonna seize your home ,  your computers ,  your car ,  your bank
account ,   ( you don't have to undress and give us yer clothes ,  unless you
have a floppy in yer pocket )  because they are all connected with your
acquisition ,  transport ,  and use of 'terrorist tools' and/or 'drug dealers
tools' - part of the wod or against terrorism ,  ya unnerstand .  .  .  no
decent american subject would be against these noble causes .  .  .  "  . 

 " note we are not accusing you of any wrong-doing  .  .  .  we are only saying
your home ,  computers ,  car ,  bank assets are connected with wrong-doing
somehow - they housed ,  transported ,  and funded these 'terrorist tools' . 
only a civil matter  .  .  .   <heh-heh>  .  .  .  we had this 'tip' .  .  . <grin> "  . 

 " therefore ,  the constitutional protection on individual rights do not
apply - we are 'arresting' the tainted property .  .  .  not you .  .  . <evil grin> "  . 

 " if you wish to deposit a bond ,  hire some attorneys ,  and go to court to
prove the innocence of this property  ( that they are not 'terrorist tools'
and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools' )  ,  go ahead , 
we have no problem with that !   'course ,  with your bank assets seized , 
no car ,  computer ,  or home ,   ( probably no job ,  too )  and your
less-than-limitless resources ,  you might run into some minor practical
difficulties <grin> .  .  .  "  . 

that is what has me going so damned ballistic .  .  .   it is exactly how
the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been
used to store drugs .  .  .   note no trace of drugs need to be found on
the property .  .  .  only some bozo who will say 'yup .   i stored stuff in
that dude's house .  .  . '  ( probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for
dealing )  .   much more cost effective to let him walk ,  to bust another
day ,  and hit the jackpot with your assets .  .  . 

ob disclaimer  ( of course )  .  .  . 

ok ,  note that i am not a lawyer ,  and can only base these speculations
on what i have read/heard/been told regarding past civil forfeiture
cases ,  and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies , 
or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone ,  or who
do not wish to be put in a risky situation  ( especially in areas where
they are denied either meaningful police protection ,  and the means to be
able to even pretend to defend themselves ,  as is quite common back east , 
like nj ,  ma ,  nyc ,  wa dc ,  or out west in ca )  .   these people have the
choice of cowering under the government boot ,  or cowering under threats
of pissed off drug dealing gang-bangers .  .  .  helpless in either case .  .  . 
all behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain ,  or behind

   the serial number will be in a 64 bit block ,  with a 34 bit filler .   doesn't
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct . 

depends on whether the filler is a constant  ( makes checking easy , 
but susceptible to replay )  ,  or variable  ( e . g .  timer ,  counter ,  random )  , 
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if they've missed messages ,  or gotten them out of
sequence ,  or other interesting things that sort of person might care about . 

it is still easy to conceal super-encryption ,  at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the k key ,  which can take a while , 
presumably not in near-real-time .    ( worst-case ,  in which the escrow agencies
provide the u key to the local cops ,  still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant ,  unless the same key is used for both directions , 
which i suppose the capstone version of the chip will probably insist on .  )

	   a 'multi-line cleartext bridge ?  " 
			 ^^^^^^^^^
	   and just were would you put that bridge ?   if it isn't at one of
   the receiptants location ,  forget encryption at all .   you have blown any
   security you thought you might have had .  

most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are
military  ( or equivalent ,  like cia and other embassy personnel )  , 
so putting bridges on the recipient's location is normal -
it's in a vault on a military base or ft .  meade ,  and the
secure phones are in sound-proof rooms with big locks on the doors
because they're talking about classified stuff  ( or golf with other generals .  ) 

that paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our
offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans
and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info
and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from bob ; 
most people don't use sound-proof vaults ,  and may use bridges in their
pbx or from the local phone company  ( 3-way calls )  or long distance
or value-added phone company  ( e . g .  alliance conference bridges )  . 

if clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones , 
the conferencing aspects don't change .   but there may be a market niche for
trusted conference-bridge providers ,  though i suppose the inquisitors
would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges , 
just in case a bad guy might use the service .

i heard somewhere  ( can't name the source )  that tempest does not necessarily
pick-up just crts ,  but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip .   if
that is true ,  the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller .   can anybody verify
or refute this ?

subject :  official secrets act  ( usa ) 

sorry ,  my news reader doesn't seem to know how to copy a subject header . 
this tracks the thread  " why people don't need strong crypto .  .  .  .  .  " 

the atomic energy act of 1954 expressly forbids *thinking* about building
nuclear devices .   while i was in grad school ,  a friend of mine got a 
security clearance to work on the defense for the progressive magazine . 
he found lots of articles which were public domain *removed* from the
local engineering library  ( madison wisconsin )  .   so the lawyers sent him
all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in
the article was already public .   what pissed everyone off was a local
underground paper went and published the article anyway  ( it had been
precensored by the feds ,  that's what this was all about )  so the judge
declared the case moot . 

the atomic energy act of 1954 has never been tested in court .   from my
discussions with several people familiar with the case ,  only 2 other
times has this preemptive clause been used .   in every case the people
simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out . 

for all intents and purposes ,  the government *does* have precidence for
declaring things classified *after* it has been published .   while i was
working on star wars this happened to me :  my clearance was in the works
and i developed a method for tracking particle beams .   it was good enough
to classify ,  so i was no longer allowed to work on it .   a friend from
canada was in the same boat :  he developed a method to compute stripping
cross sections ,  but because the subject was classified *he was not allowed
to present his own paper at a conference ! * .   he later published it in an
open journal without problems . 

when the going gets wierd ,  the wierd turn pro .   the feds can do whatever
they want whenever they feel like it ,  and they will make up rules to let
themselves get away with it .   since the mass media can't tell the difference
between a joke and the real thing  ( like  " ranch appocolypse "  for the waco
massacre )  don't count on them to help spread the word about their loss
of freedom .   the government *can* make strong crypto illegal .   so what ? 
since the government does not obey any of its own rules ,  why should we ?

ok steve ,  here's a sketch of an alternative that i believe addresses
most of the objections to the clipper scheme . 

notation : 
	+	concatenation
	^	exclusive or
	e ( m , k ) 	message m encrypted by key k
	d ( m , k ) 	message m decrypted by key k
	h ( m ) 	hash  ( digest/signature )  of message m

important values : 
	u0[x]		local chip unit key from escrow agency x
	u1[x]		remote chip unit key from escrow agency x
	n[0]		serial number of the local chip
	n[1]		serial number of the remote chip
	a		number of escrow agencies
	k[0] , k[1]	 " session keys "  agreed upon external to this protocol
	f		 " family key "  ,  need not be secret

protocol : 
	choose k0[1] ,  .  .  . k0[a] such that k[0] = k0[1]^ .  .  . ^k0[a]
	remote chip does same for k[1] , k1[1] ,  .  .  .  , k1[a] . 

	compute the following : 

		l0[1] = e ( k0[1] ,  u0[1] ) 
		 .  .  . 
		l0[a] = e ( k0[a] ,  u0[a] ) 

		l[0] = n[0] + e ( n[0] + l0[1] +  .  .  .  + l0[a] ,  f ) 

		remote chip does the same for l1[1] ,  .  .  .  , l1[a] , l[1]

	send l[0] to remote chip and receive l[1] from remote chip

	compute : 

		ke[0] = h ( k[0] + n[0] + l0[1] +  .  .  .  + l0[a]
			+ k[1] + d ( l[1] ,  f ) 

		kd[0] = h ( k[1] + d ( l[1] ,  f ) 
			+ k[0] + n[0] + l0[1] +  .  .  .  + l0[a]

		note that d ( l[1] ,  f )  = n[1] + l1[1] +  .  .  .  + l1[a]

		remote chip does the same for ke[1] and kd[1]

	user data is encrypted  ( decrypted )  with keys ke[0] ,  ke[1]
		 ( kd[0] ,  kd[1] ) 

assumptions : 
	no trap doors in e (  )  ,  d (  )  and h (  )  .  h (  )  is not invertible . 

	algorithms for e (  )  ,  d (  )  and h (  )  are secret .  otherwise a software
	implementation  ( bogus chip )  could communicate with a real chip . 

	the chip only supports the following operation : 

		1 )   return n[0]
		2 )   load k0[x]
		3 )   return e ( k0[x] ,  u0[x] ) 
		4 )   return e ( n[0] + l0[1] +  .  .  .  + l0[a] ,  f ) 
		5 )   given e ( n[1] + l1[1] +  .  .  .  + l1[a] ,  f )  , 
			return n[1] , l1[1] ,  .  .  .  , l1[a]
		6 )   load k[1]
		7 )   given e ( n[1] + l1[1] +  .  .  .  + l1[a] ,  f )  , 
			compute ke[0] ,  kd[0]
		8 )   given m ,  return e ( m ,  ke[0] ) 
		9 )   given m ,  return d ( m ,  kd[0] ) 

	anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying
	the chip  ( u[1] ,  .  .  .  , u[a] , f , n[0] )  . 

	u[1] ,  .  .  .  , u[a] can not be determined except by destroying the chip . 
	 ( unfortunately this may not be true in reality .  i suppose it's
	possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a
	sophisticated[sp ? ] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses .  ) 

	the u's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies . 

notes : 
	for tapping escrow agency y is given n[0] ,  e ( k0[y] ,  u0[y] )  ,  n[1] , 
	e ( k1[y] ,  u1[y] )  and returns k0[y] ,  k1[y] . 

	lea's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from
	both chips and the encrypted partial keys .  this allows the agencies
	to record that both chips were tapped . 

	lea's only get the session key ,  not the key to all conversations
	of a particular chip .  this precludes real-time decrypting of a
	conversation but that isn't one of the stated requirements . 

observation : 
	in order for any secure by  " tap-able "  communication scheme to work , 
	the active parts need to share a secret .  and if this secret is
	revealed ,  communications by those that know the secret can be made
	 " un-tap-able "  .  obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm
	and the master  ( family )  key .  relative size and complexity suggests
	that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the
	scheme a lot easier and faster than the algorithm .

why not ?   it hasn't been released ,  so there's no way for you to evaluate it 
yet .   after all ,  apple could have been smart and had aoce use an md5 hash 
encrypted with rsa ,  just like pkcs signatures .   they could even be actually 
pkcs compliant ,  for all you know ;  why not wait until it is released ,  and hard 
information is available ,  before passing judgement on it ? 

aoce's algorithm's aren't secret because apple's being fascistic--aoce itself 
remains secret  ( except for apple demos at macworld  :  )  )  ,  simply because it's 
not done yet . 

it may be flawed ,  and it may not .   however ,  you can't tell which until you 
actually see it .   i ,  at least ,  am quite impressed with what i have seen so 
far ,  and have no expectation of being disappointed .

yes ,  but the extra encryption could be applied *before* the message
is encrypted by the clipper ,  so that the wrapper would be fine ,  the
phone's serial number and the session key would be in the law-enforcement
field ,  etc .  ,  but the message wouldn't be readable even if the particular
clipper's key were obtained from the escrow agents .   in fact ,  it shouldn't
even be possible to detect that a message has been double-encrypted without
a court order ,  right ?

i was under the impression  ( from reading denning's description of the
clipper's operation )  that the same session key *is* used in both directions for
encrypting the message text ,  but that each chip uses it's own key for
encrypting the session key into the law-enforcement field .   so ,  you only
need to know the u key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
messages in both directions .

i have ,  my thesis was on sun tzu . 

more to the point : 

those who are called the good militarists of old ,  could make opponents
lost contact between front and back lines ,  lose reliability between
large and small groups ,  lose mutual concern for the welfare of the
different social classes among them ,  lose mutual accomodation between
the rulers and the ruled ,  lose enlistments among the soldiers ,  lose
coherence within the armies .   they went into action when it was
advantageous ,  stopped when it was not . 

today it is .   sitting on your hands will get you nowhere in this battle .

is this  " white house e-mail address "  really working yet ?  someone
posted such an address on compuserve a few months ago ,  but apparently
the white house wasn't really set up to recive hundreds  ( thousands ?  ) 
of messages a day to that account and didn't want people to use it
yet .  so is this mci address something the people at the white house
actually read ,  or is it another craig shergold story ?  i don't know --
i'm just asking . 

unless the people at the white house print and distribute this mail
every day ,  you may have better luck printing out a letter  ( on paper , 
that flat white stuff all over my desk )  and snail-mailing it to the
white house .  i imagine writing to your local representative and
senator wouldn't hurt either .  heck ,  why not write to al gore while
you're at it ?

i don't believe you ,  and i don't believe your friend . 

why ?  

because des is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily
availble .  unless your friend knows something and is keeping it secret , 
he was bullshitting you . 

now ,  it is possible that he noted a weakness in the *implementation* of
the kerberos protocol .  for instance ,  using a weak rng to generate keys
might cut down on the keyspace  ( not for the user keys -- for the other
kind who's name i can't remember )  .  however ,  this is not what was
claimed .  you are claiming a general weakness in des ,  which is not
known to exist in the open literature . 

don't get me wrong -- des is weaker than it should be .  however , 
cracking it in 15 minutes requires more money be spent on the cracking
machine than any organization i know of has available .

	this is a real address .  my understanding of the current process
that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed
by retiree volunteers ,  who match the message against message profiles
and check the message count .   ( i . e .  :   " yeah ,  that's a for gays in the
military .  what's this clipper stuff ?  must be against gays in the
military .  .  .  "  ) 

	the higher-volume white-house email stuff is in the works , 
i know for a fact ,  but won't be online for probably another month
or two at the soonest .  my understanding is that the link speed will
increase  ( direct internet instead of compu$erve to floppy )  but the
message processing will remain the same .

	the white house email does get read .  i agree that printing it
and sending cc :  to everyone you can think of is probably better because
it is more visible ,  but the message processing  ( fitting messages against
a template )  is the same in either case .

from the us law perspective ,  unless you're engaging in illegal speech , 
it's not illegal to use encryption .   yet .   the nsa is allowed to try
to listen ,  but you're not obligated to make it easy for them .   yet . 
the other country may have more repressive laws about that ; 
i gather france's bureaucracy wants to know what you're saying ,

 ( paranoia follows ,  for those of you who want to play it safe  : - ) 
the fact that the nsa is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies ,  but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate rsa's patents ,  e . g .  if you use pgp ,  the
nsa may tell rsa that you're doing so ,  and if the secret service catches on , 
they may decide that the mere fact that rsa hasn't filed a lawsuit
against you doesn't mean that you don't deserve to have your computer
confiscated for possible patent violation ,  munitions law violation , 
espionage ,  money laundering ,  drug importation ,  and creatin' a disturbance ,

   i heard somewhere  ( can't name the source )  that tempest does not necessarily
   pick-up just crts ,  but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip .   if
   that is true ,  the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything
   on the screen can be picked-up from the video controller .   can anybody verify
   or refute this ? 

yes ,  that's true .   tempest is nothing magic ,  it's just listening to any
available electromagnetic emissions and using all the analysis techniques  
you know to separate out the interesting stuff .  

the nice thing about old crts is that they used to put out lots of
signal ,  so they're easy to detect ,  and if you do your sync carefully , 
you can watch the output on the monitor in your deceptively-marked
chevy step-van .   some brands of electric typewriters were even worse . 
in both cases ,  it's especially nice because it gets you the data the
user is looking at ,  rather than whatever stuff the paging algorithm is
paging out to disk ,  etc . 

with newer ,  quieter equipment ,  there isn't as much signal ,  and it's harder to
isolate the fun parts .   tempest-rated equipment has much lower signal levels . 
but  " everything has vibrations "  ,  as master chuan said .

just thought of something .   yes ,  laptops can still be read ,  but it's not quite
as easy as a normal pc with a crt .   my thought ,  airline pilots lately have
been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's
instruments .   if this can be hyped up ,  manufacturers may start building
laptops with even lower emmisions .   it would probably still be possible to
pick up with surveillance equipment ,  but at this point ,  it would be a lot
cheaper to mask the remaining signals with tempest techniques .

   you should probably use numbers much larger than 64-bits .   also ,  you
may want to include some randomly-generated bitstrings in your protocol . 
this way ,  if someone should find the shared key you and another person
use on one day ,  they won't be able to guess it for the next day .  .  .  . 
 
   ie a sends g**a mod p and random string r0
      b sends g**b mod p and random string r1
 
      both find  ( g**a mod p ) ** b mod p = shared key ,  then both calculate
 
      session key = hash ( r0 , shared key ,  r1 ) 
 
   also ,  you will want to make sure that you're getting the right public
key value g**a mod p .   someone with the power to intercept and change messages
can oterwise spoof you by sending both of you *his* public key ,  and then
acquiring a session key with each of you .  .  .  .

subject :  a trojan horse on the clipper

gentlefolk , 

        it seems to me that the  " step 1 "  of taking a warrant to the
        telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring  ( don't
        you love animal metaphors )  . 

        with each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip
         (  " e ( n ; f )  "  is not syntactically different than  " n "  )  ,  all they
        have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of
        today's target and use the serial number to identify the
        session they want ,  and get the chip number of the other end of
        the conversation .  even without the key ,  this is great for
        traffic analysis .  i can think of several ways to learn the
        right serial number . 

        it looks like one intended effect of the clipper is to
        eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to
        cooperate  ( or risking getting caught in the act with your
        alligator clips erect )  .  this is particularly handy if you have
        s1 and s2 . 

        btw ,  did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial
        number ? 
        
        cheers , 
                marc

        only guessing ,  but from his address i'd say that jerry ,  like
        me ,  lives in canada .  unlike me ,  he thinks that our friends in
        the us enjoy the same freedom that we do ,  and he has not seen
        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us . 

        we have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and
        ineffective law enforcement .  our rednecks tend to be the
        objects of derision rather than elected officials .  it's
        everything le can do to keep up with the real criminals .  any
        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't
        like his or her attitude ,  it's national news  ( it also often
        blows up in their faces :  eg .  the well-intentioned but flawed
        zundel case ,  which resulted in a scolding from the supreme
        court ,  not only to le for prosecuting the case but to
        parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under )  . 

        our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of
        it .  among other things they have as many le agencies as we
        have agencies ,  and some of them have teeth .  they also have the
        war on drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional
        powers to ignore individuals' rights  ( the dea has more
        arbitrary power than that given to canadian agencies under the
        war measures act )  .  we have the rcmp and csis who can't stop
        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective
        suppression of private citizens' rights .  not only that ,  our
        police commissions have teeth ,  as i learned when i had to fend
        off a bent cop . 

        it may be ironic that the nation founded on life ,  liberty and
        the pursuit of happiness is getting government-imposed order , 
        while the nation founded on peace ,  order and good government
        is getting in-your-face liberty . 

        that's not to say our time won't come .  it looks like chretien
        is going to run on a law-and-order platform .  be afraid . 

        cheers ,

        there's a better way .  doesn't qualcom have a secure design

but the nsa will not be doing any wiretapping .   the actual wiretapping will , 
presumably ,  be conducted by the fbi .   of course ,  the capability for this was
provided by the nsa ,  but i think that they are still within the limitations
of their charter . 

i realize this is a fine point ,  and some may differ ,  but this is my opinion . 
although i don't care for clipper and won't support or use it ,  i don't see
the nsa as having overstepped their bounds .

it also goes like this : 

fed1 :  we need to listen into <mafia head/druglord/terrorist/bbs sysop>'s
      conversations but don't have probable cause for a tap . 

fed2 :  who do we have a tap on ? 

fed1 :  <some other enemy of the state> . 

fed2 :  so get the keys - we can always claim that phone's being used on the
      tapped line . 

there's got to be some way to associate an instrument with an individual or
the state effectively has a tap ,  possibly not admissible  ( given the war on
drugs exceptions to the 4/5 ammendments ,  who knows )  but none the less
listenable tap on any phone .

subject :  re :  let's build software cryptophones for over the internet .  .  . 

hmmm .  .  .  .  celp takes up about 12 . 6 mips for full duplex ,  and has been
implemented on about a million dsp chips .  .  .  the 56001 card in my pc only cost
about $700 ,  and i'm sure once demand goes up the prices would drop .  the analog
devices 21020 board that we're looking at now cost about $500  ( academic price )  . 
i don't think hardware is something to worry about .  .  .  if you get it working , 
people will snap up internet phone cards like there was no tomorrow . 
what we need here is a good implementation of celp  ( the government code is
absolute crap ,  i got a 30% speedup after looking at it for a couple of hours )  , 
and modifications to pgp to allow it to compress/decompress 144 bit frames
every 30msec .  .  .  i think the ad21020 should have enough juice for this  ( 50mips )  . 
as part of the project i'm working on now ,  we're trying to get celp up and
running in realtime full duplex mode .  .  .  i gotta find the source to pgp and
see how tough it would be to integrate the en/decryption parts into the code . 
i'll play with it .  anyone else out there got an ad21020 setup ?

as anyone who attended hohocon will attest ,  you can pick information

from :  steve-b@access . digex . com  ( steve brinich ) 
subject :  basic crypto requirements


  in order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography
policies are acceptable ,  we must set forth a list of basic requirements . 
i would propose the following as a starting point : 

  1 .  the algorithm must be publicly known ,  and must have a record of
       surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses . 

  2 .  the system implementation must make it possible to verify that the
       advertised algorithm is ,  in fact ,  the one that is being used . 

  3 .  the key must be quickly changeable by the user ,  and must be of a
       sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute-force search
       possible now or in the reasonably near future . 

  note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key
escrow system ;  the may 1993 issue of  " byte "  describes an example of an
encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent
with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be
escrowed in order to have one's public key listed by a central distributor .

you can find what you're looking for on hundreds of sites worldwide .   try

	anonymous ftp to nic . funet . fi  ( finland ) 

	/pub/unix/4 . 3bsd/net2/lib/libc/gen/crypt . c . z

this includes source code for fully-functional des encryption and decryption . 

there are some who believe that public domain code is exportable ,  some
who don't .   make your own judgements ,  but it seems obvious to me .

i'm afraid i have to disagree with you on that point .   nsa will *not*

well ,  regardless of what policy liabilities anyone in washington may think
eff has ,  it is going ahead aggressively attacking the assumptions that are
behind the administrations clipper chip initiative .   for all the reasons
stated here .   in washington ,  you have to work under the assumption that 
everyone has some liabilities .   government and non-governmental 
organizations alike all share the same glass house .   eff is variously
identified as the hacker defense fund ,  the first amendment absolutists , 
the new communists ,  etc ,  but it is also an acknowledged leader in the
civil liberties arena and is respected as a serious player in the 
policy circles .   so unless there is another organization with the
credibility and clout and right policy stance that you know of in
washington ,  please don't count eff out as a valid representative of
your views in the clipper chip matter .

        this one is easy ,  they 'tape' the conversation ,  call the fbi or

there are several things in itar which have never been tested in court .  
the concensus appears to be : 

you could be arrested as an international arms trafficker .    ( you could , 
regardless of the state of the law ,  but there are some paragraphs which
suggest you would be violating the law .  ) 

if it goes to court ,  the itars could be thrown out is incompatible with the
first amendment ;  or the court could rule that  " software "  is  " technical
data "  not subject to the itars ;  or the court could rule that the
phrase  " publicly available "  as defined in the itars would apply , 
making it only subject to requiring a general export license ;  or ,  you could
be prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage .   general
concensus among lawyers who have read the itars ,  is that one of the first
two would occur .

i'd use a secret  ( nope ,  obscure )  cryptographic encoding to expand the 
30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block .  the redundancy hereby introduced 
can be used to detect tampered clipper signals where some public enemy 
replaced the l . e .  block by random data .  

and of course the l . e .  block would be used to initialise the encryption 
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct l . e .  block must 
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back .  

for those of you who might want to mangle the l . e .  block  ( e . g .  by xor-ing 
a constant pattern )  on the transmission line and restore it before feeding 
it into the receiving crippler chip i would add further encrypted copies 
of this block  ( perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption 
algorithm or so )  at regular intervals during the transmission .  if the 
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and 
it will cease to work ;  in your own interest you are protected from getting 
faulty plaintext ,  you know -- it's just like a checksum for your own 
safety  ; - (  .  

the `monitoring agencies' won't have the famous black box which is needed 
for actual decryption and will be kept by the fbi ;  but nothing prevents 
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the 
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded l . e .  blocks 
within the transmission .  these boxes will turn a red light on as soon as 
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol . 

so don't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool l . e .  about the 
tapping key -- i bet the developpers have provided much better checks 
than those suggested above .  of course it's absolutely crucial that the 
algorithms  ( and protocols )  remain secret .  personally i doubt they will .

hi , 

i'd like to thank you all for the fast responses .  
special thanks go to those who replied  ( lexical order )  :

tarnold@vnet . ibm . com  ( todd w .  arnold ) 
wcs@anchor . ho . att . com  ( bill stewart )  

my question was : 

>how sensible is des encrypted data towards bit errors ?  how much data per
>bit will be lost in average  ( i assume you still have the correct key )  ? 

how much of the des-encrypted data is affected depends on the used
encryption mode .  according to marcus j ranum  ( mjr@tis . com )  there is : 

|	cfb = cipher feedback mode
|	ecb = electronic code book mode
|	cbc = cipher block chaining mode
|	ofb = output feedback mode
|
|	each mode does some stuff better than others .  ofb and cfb are designed
|for communications streams more than for files . 

unfortunally ,  people strongly disagree which mode will lead to destruction
of all of the following data .  sure seems that some modes will resync quite
fast ,  others will never ,  others will even only effect the very block . 

summarized ,  people said concerning *this* matter : 

/
|in cbc mode ,  only the current block will be affected  ( tarnold@vnet . ibm . com 
|<todd w .  arnold> )  . 
|
|if you use cbc  ( cihper block chaining )  ,  then the remainder of the data
|will be destroyed as well .   ( pausch@saaf . se <paul schlyter> ) 
|
|in cfb mode ,  des synchronizes quite fast  ( probably within 1 block 
|according to maracus j ranum <mjr@tis . com> )  . 
\

maybe someone *definitely* knows what happens in which mode ? 

nevertheless ,  thank you all very much again .

it depends on the mode you're using .   for a single 64-bit input block ,  a
one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits - in other words ,  it essentially turns the output block into
a random number .   if you're encrypting data in cbc mode ,  however ,  only the
one 64-bit block will be affected .   the next block ,  and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly . 

it's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely .

at least 8 bytes of data will be destroyed if one bit encrypted data is
in error . 

if you use cbc  ( cihper block chaining )  ,  then the remainder of the data
will be destroyed as well . 

des is very seisitive for single bit errors .   this is as it should be .

probably very bad ;  you might lose the rest of the data stream .   if you
want safety against dropped bits use an error correcting coder like the
freeware gnu ecc .

   how sensible is des encrypted data towards bit errors ?  how much data per
   bit will be lost in average  ( i assume you still have the correct key )  ? 

it depends on the mode you're using des in . 
electronic code book  ( ecb )  takes a block of 64 input bits
and produces 64 output bits ,  so if any bits are changed , 
the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad . 
i forget which feedback mode is which . 
in all of them ,  the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks . 
with some modes ,  the system self-synchronizes ,  so errors are repaired
in a few blocks .   with other modes ,  once one block is bad , 
all later blocks will be bad too . 

there's also the framing problem .   if you have a bit change , 
the block that it's in changes ,  and maybe later blocks also change . 
but if you have bits lost or bits added  ( 64 bits in ,  63 or 65 bits out )  , 
everything is confused after that . 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

from :  marcus j ranum <mjr@tis . com>

	depends on the mode you're using .  cfb ,  for example ,  synchronises
pretty fast .  figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the
next one .

big deal .  if you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a
legitimate wiretap order ,  you just listen in on the line for 10
minutes ,  get the serial number ,  and then take the order and go to the
escrow agencies .  if you notice the criminal is now using a different
phone instrument ,  take your still-valid wiretap order to the escrow
agency with the new serial number .   ( this provides opportunities for
abuse by law enforcement ,  but thats not what we are discussing right
now .  )  i oppose clipper ,  but the mechanics here are simple and easy to
understand .  the whole rest of your article is based on a large series
of false premises ,  all predicated on the notion that this simple act
is somehow impossible . 

i feel free to presume to tell you that you do not seem to understand
the mechanics of the proposal .  arguing that terrorists will be killing
people for their clipper phones is silly because its pointless .  lets
be alarmist about what really would show up as a problem ,  shall we ?

one thing that seems ambiguous is whether a signal being echoed down from
geosynchronous orbit is  "  .  .  . from outside the united states .  " 

also ,  being able to assess whether nsa is playing by the rules requires
knowing what the rules are .  we only know a subset .  for those even more
suspicious ,  there could be other surveillance organizations  " blacker " 
than the nsa .

subject :  re :  dorothy denning opposes clipper ,  capstone wiretap chips

the *security* of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys . 

the ability to tap is an inherent *insecurity* which depends fundamentally on
the secrecy of the algorithm .   to spell it out ,  because so many people seem to
miss the point ,  if the algorithm were published ,  anyone could create a chip
which would work correctly with the skipjack chips but which would not have
its key registered . 

i believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the
government maintaining a secret of some kind .   for example ,  the secret could be
the private keys of the escrow agencies ;  their digital signatures would be
required before a key could be used .   in this case ,  the nsa/nist/whoever has
decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easier/cheaper/more secure than
other possible protocols .

thanks .  got that from two other sources as well .  the full quote is as
follows : 

from dorothy denning ,  cryptography and data security ,  addison-wesley
1982 , 1983 ,  page 8 : 

 " cryptosystems must satisfy three general requirements : 

 " 1 .  the enciphering and deciphering transformations must be efficient for
all keys . 

 " 2 .  the system must be easy to use . 

 " 3 .  the security of the system should depend only on the secrecy of the
keys and not on the secrecy of algorithms e [enciphering] or d
[deciphering] .  "

congress isn't forced to do anything .   not even follow their own rules ,

  wes's list is of  " do " s and  " don't " s for writing your congressional
representatives is a fine one but i'd like to encourage people to pay
extra attention to the point above .   as cliched as the saying may be
it's nevertheless true that you can catch more flies with honey than
with vinegar . 

  while the writing styles prevalent on the net possess a certain charm
please remember that the person reading your letter is likely to be
uninfluenced or negatively influenced if you express your concerns in
a way that makes you sound like a flake or a paranoid crackpot .   wild
and unsupported accusations about the menace from the nsa will not
carry much weight ,  nor are overblown conclusions about the inevitable

that attempt strained analogies to the rise of the nazi party .   please
save the niemoller quote for another letter .  .  ) 

  if you want your opinions to be taken seriously it is *very* important
that you state those opinions in a manner that is understandable and 
seems reasonable to a layman .   don't overburden your reader with technical
details or expect them to know the history of various encryption 
technologies .   before you mail it ,  hand your letter to a non-technical
friend and ask them to sanity-check it . 

  above all ,  realize that legislators are often motivated as much by
self-interest as by anything else .   try to point out risks in terms that
will be meaningful and motivating to them such as the loss of individual
privacy rights or the damage restrictive export regulations do to american
businesses' ability to compete in the global marketplace .   pull the 
strings that you think will work with your legislator -- if your
legislator is unlikely to be swayed by civil-rights concerns then point out
how a government-granted monopoly for mycotronx damages the competitiveness
of businesses in your district that manufacture or market phone or crypto

   actually ,  david ,  i don't think it's any more intellectually honest to
say there are no backdoors than to say there are backdoors ,  unless you've
had a chance to examine the algorithm and the silicon closely .   for all
we know ,  skipjack could be easily broken ,  or impossible to break .   and
clearly ,  if skipjack is not secure ,  then the clipper chip is not worth much .

subject :  re :  subliminal channels in dss

may i suggest that any any proposed cipher system
having less entropy than the user's key and message can have
an embedded subliminal channel as big as the
difference in entropies between the entropy of the user
input  ( message )  and the entropy of the output ? 

for example ,  take plain des .   the unsuspecting
user inputs a string  " plaintext "  to be enciphered . 

he cranks the algorithm which has been hacked
by george quisling and comes out with j*3h4902d . 

nine char in and nine chars out .   right ? 

the unsepecting user ships the ciphertext
to be decrpyted and the message  " plaintext " 
is produced .   everything fine ,  right ?   nope . 


imagine the algorithm did a lz compression
on plaintext before desing .   ( compressing is
down to four characters with more entropy : 

9#wj

the opponent now pads the message with his
own message ,  also compressed

*3dk@

before applying des to the concatenated
compressed pairs .   when decrpyted ,  the
first compressed message is stripped off
and declared sent .   unbeknowst to the
receiver ,  the opponents accomplice collects
the remaining message in the bit bucket and
uncompresses to kill now . 

and to prevent all such subliminal or covert
storage channels you would need to have 
maximal entropy all the time -- which is
a priori impossible because  ( for example ) 
a stereotypical message might be
replaced by one bit in the output reserving
the rest of the output bits for the long
covert message . 

in other words ,  if you opponent get to muck
with the algorithm -- you either have got to
muck with it last or concede his possible 
embedding of covert channels . 

in other words ,  if you present a message
to an opponet with less than maximal entropy
then you have given him free bits of storage .

david reeve sward <sward+@cmu . edu> writes : 
> we don't know this ,  do we ?   the algorithm is classified .  

i speculate ,  from the mykotronx data sheet on the myk-78 ,  that the algorithm 
is a classified cryptosystem ,  similar in application to des but cleared by 
the nsa for classified traffic ,  that has been in use for a number of years .   
myktotronx refers to it as  " government type ii encryption "  ,  which matches the 
designation of one of the types of encryption available on stu-iii phones ,  
and may be the same as a cryptosystem i have heard called  " cipher2 "  . 

this would make sense ,  since this is evidently a field-proven cryptosystem 
which can act as a  " pin-compatible "  substitute for des .   combined with a 
tappable key exchange protocol ,  this would offer exactly what is claimed for 
clipper :  secure encryption with access via a key escrow .   if this is fact the 
case ,  it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself . 

now ,  i do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem ;  my knowledge 
of classified cryptography isn't even fuzzy  :  )  ,  it's nonexistent .   however ,  
it would certainly have been the least-effort approach on the part of the 
government :  take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of des 
 ( and which is at least as secure )  ,  set up a key escrow scheme for law 
enforcement ,  and promote it for public use .   this also fits with mykotronx ,  
who's been around but almost invisible for years . 

has anyone else made this sort of connection ,  or am i just hallucinating pink 
elephants here ?   :  )  .   my curiousity has been piqued .  .  .

hmmm .  .  .  i wouldn't consider encryption to be a weapon .   how would the
government classify encryption ?   seems to me that encryption ought to
be covered by the first amendment .    using this line of reasoning ,  the
government shouldn't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and
what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting
one's freedom of speech .   in other words ,  encrypted data---text , 
graphics ,  or other information---is just another form of free speech . 
for this reason the government shouldn't be able to regulate the use
of encryption algorithms and encrypted data .   the only time the
government should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her
encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data
in question may be something that isn't protected by the first
amendment such as kiddy porn .   even in a case like this the
government should be required to get a search warrant before coercing
someone into revealing the keys . 

btw ,  what encryption methods are considered to be state-of-the-art
nowdays .   have the feds relaxed export restrictions on des yet ? 
also ,  is des still regarded as a good form of encryption ?

subject :  clipper chip :  reverse engineering

i have been looking over the postings about the clipper chip and noticed
an interesting omission from the discussion . 

you all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed 
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software . 

the question that i have is why cant someone take one of these chips
and reverse engineer it ?  i mean ,  take the thing to a chip testing/
analysis facility ,  one with a decent electron microscope .  just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry .  i remembered a place that i use
to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out while running tests .  they could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was .  

i am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities
and that the potential is there ,  especially at a university where the
security at such a facility is looser ,  for someone to take a clipper
apart and analyze it ? 

what can the government do to prevent this ?  start taking away all 
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes ?  ?

dear senator/congressman/president {fill in the blank}

i am writing you to voice my strong opposition to president clinton's clipper 
chip initiative .  this proposal to establish a secret government designed
cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
encryption is very disturbing .  the idea that citizens must register their 
secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret 
is patently unamerican .  additionally ,  the press release for this program
strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the 
clipper chip standard is in place .  this latest attack on our civil rights is 
deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me .  

the presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this 
is not the case .  the fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment 
is avalible the criminals ,  drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press 
release will simply use non clipper cryptography .  meanwhile the average citizen
may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the 
government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation .  this seems like an 
obvious back door for the nsa and law enforcement .  if you still do nott 
understand my objection to key registration ,  consider the way j .  edgar hoover 
blackmailed government officials like yourself ;  would you now use a phone to 
transmit personal details of your life that the nsa and fbi have the keys to ?

because much of the public aren't even aware of the names of informative
publications .   look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand . 
unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment ,  with
the usual trade journals ,  all they ever see is the media  ( note :  media
in this context is the popular media - tv ,  radio ,  daily newspapers ,  and
such publications as time ,  newsweek ,  and all that )  .   and they all say
pretty much the same thing .   i see most of them being in the range of
center-left to far left ,  and generally supportive of pie-in-sky
we-will-take- care-of-you-think-for-you-cradle-to-grave .   there seems
to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of
understanding major issues so the media doesn't bother to inform them
 ( as with clipper ,  for example )  or tells the people how to interpret
events in others .   what is lost sight of is that the people are not good
at understanding things because they are not told accurate information
about them .   it is a lot to expect of the people for them to be
clarirvoyant .   for example ,  i would have been unaware of clipper had
i not picked it up on usenet .   how much of the population has usenet , 
let alone internet access ? 

for access to better publications ,  the person has to spend time digging . 
many folks ,  especially who work long hours ,  have families ,  etc .  ,  do not
have time to go digging ,  and many are not  ( yet )  aware things are wrong , 
so are not motivated to dig .   not saying its right ,  just saying that is
the way things are .   people aren't upset about things when they aren't
told .   and the less than objective media is a major contributer to the
problem . 

and then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service
 ( bureaucrats ,  politicians )  that act as if the person without political
connections ,  or deep pockets  ( potential contributer )  should have few if
any rights ,  being a resource to be used by those in control for their
polticial or financial gain .   some law enforcement agencies act as if
they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt , 
peons that are supposed to do what they are told ,  and get very nasty
when someone questions them .   the media pundits/editors ,  etc tend to
fall into those with privilege ,  and tend to not be upset by the current
state of affairs .   the fellow in dc ,  who shot the swimmer in his jacuzzi
for daring to swim in it ,  with an illegally owned gun  ( violating the law
he pushed to be foisted on everyone else )  ,  ends up walking where a less
well-connected person would have been crucified .   a typical example of
one standard for 'us' ,  a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk' . 

perhaps i am not real eloquent in expressing this ,  but the solution
sure as hell is not to make it harder for people to find out what is
going on ,  or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position
where one feels they are exempt or insulated .   such as that hypocrite of
a journalist in dc described above .   one notices that these less-than
complimentary points about that double-standard was not covered in the
media .   i feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views
on the subject ,  and it involved a 'brother' journalist . 

isn't it time for our 'objective' media ,  the main source of info for the
average person ,  to start being what they claim to be ,  instead of spin
doctors for the statist elements ?

are you in contact with her ,  is that what she said ,  or what you think
her reason is ? 

also ,  could it be possible that she is not replying because she has
no reply that wouldn't confirm the worst suspicions ?   if the suspicions
are way out of pocket ,  one would think the person would be in there
saying so ,  and indicating why they are out of pocket .   hiding behind
a veil of secrecy is not reassuring .

  from crossbows to cryptography :   thwarting the state via
                     technology

  given at the future of freedom conference ,  november 1987


     you   know ,    technology--and   particularly   computer
technology--has often gotten a bad rap in  libertarian  cir-
cles .   we tend to think of orwell's 1984 ,  or terry gilliam's
brazil ,   or  the  proximity  detectors keeping east berlin's
slave/citizens on their own side of the border ,  or  the  so-
phisticated  bugging  devices  nixon used to harass those on
his  " enemies list .  "   or ,  we recognize that for the price  of
a  ticket  on  the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound ,  but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by
a  government  policeman ,  and permit him to paw thru our be-
longings if it beeps . 

     but i think that mind-set is a mistake .    before  there
were cattle prods ,  governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs  and  rubber  hoses .     before  there  were lasers for
eavesdropping ,  governments used binoculars and  lip-readers . 
though  government certainly uses technology to oppress ,  the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools . 

     in fact ,  technology represents one of the most  promis-
ing  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them .   by its very nature ,   it  favors
the  bright   ( who can put it to use )  over the dull  ( who can-
not )  .   it favors the adaptable  ( who are  quick  to  see  the
merit  of  the  new   ( over  the sluggish  ( who cling to time-
tested ways )  .   and what two better words are  there  to  de-
scribe government bureaucracy than  " dull "  and  " sluggish "  ? 

     one  of  the  clearest ,   classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny i see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable
crossbow .    with it ,  an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if
that  target  were  a mounted ,  chain-mailed knight .    ( unlike
the longbow ,  which ,  admittedly was more powerful ,  and  could
get  off  more shots per unit time ,  the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize .    whereas the  longbow  required
elaborate  visual ,   tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy ,  the wielder  of  a  crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder ,  sight along the
arrow  itself ,  and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-
get .  ) 

     moreover ,  since just about  the  only  mounted  knights
likely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors ,  the utility of the  device  was
plain :     with it ,  the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another ,  but against their governmental
masters .    it was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-
piercing  bullet ,   and ,  consequently ,  kings and priests  ( the
medieval equivalent of a  bureau  of  alcohol ,   tobacco  and
crossbows )   threatened  death  and  excommunication ,  respec-
tively ,  for its unlawful possession . 

     looking at later developments ,  we  see  how  technology
like  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun ,  later followed by the gatling gun and more advanced
machine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal
and inter-group power .   not without reason was the colt   . 45
called  " the equalizer .  "   a frail dance-hall hostess with one
in  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon .     advertise-
ments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that   " a  man  on
horseback ,   armed with one of these rifles ,  simply cannot be
captured .  "   and ,  as long as his captors  were  relying  upon
flintlocks  or  single-shot rifles ,  the quote is doubtless a
true one . 

     updating now to  the  present ,   the  public-key  cipher
 ( with  a  personal  computer to run it )  represents an equiv-
alent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon .     not  only  can
such  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one's
own possession ,  but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-
change   information   over   an   insecure   communications
channel--a  wiretapped   phone   line ,    for   example ,    or
skywriting ,  for that matter ) --without ever having previously
met  to  exchange cipher keys .    with a thousand-dollar com-
puter ,  you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  cray
x-mp  can't  crack in a year .   within a few years ,  it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-
cations ;  soon after that ,  full-color digitized video images . 
technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete ,   it
will  have  totally demolished government's control over in-
formation transfer . 

     i'd like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-
ics  which makes this principle possible .   this algorithm is
called the rsa algorithm ,  after rivest ,  shamir ,  and  adleman
who  jointly created it .   its security derives from the fact
that ,  if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very
large  primes ,   then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis  of  their  product .      " ex-
tremely "   in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100
digits apiece ,  then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-
eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful
computer now in existence . 

     the   " public "  part of the key consists of  ( 1 )  the prod-
uct  pq  of the two large primes p and q ,  and  ( 2 )   one  fac-
tor ,   call it  x   ,  of the product  xy  where  xy = { ( p-1 )  *
 ( q-1 )  + 1} .   the  " private "  part of the key consists  of  the
other factor  y . 

     each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integer--either by using ascii ,   or  even  a  simple
a=01 ,   b=02 ,   c=03 ,   .  .  .   ,  z=26 representation .   this integer
is then raised to the power  x  ( modulo pq )  and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message .   the receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the   ( secret )   power    y
 ( modulo  pq )  .   it can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with . 

     what makes this a groundbreaking development ,   and  why
it  is  called   " public-key "   cryptography ,  "   is  that i can
openly publish the product  pq and the number   x    ,   while
keeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message ,  namely
                       x
                     a     ( mod pq )    , 
but only i can recover the original message  a   ,  by  taking
what  they  send ,  raising it to the power  y  and taking the
result  ( mod pq )  .   the risky step  ( meeting to exchange cipher
keys )  has been eliminated .   so people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet ,  may  still  reliably  ex-
change  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and
disseminated his own  pq  and his  x   ,    while  maintaining
the secrecy of his own  y . 

     another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a  " dig-
ital signature ,  "  to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message .   normally ,  if i want to send you a message , 
i raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result   ( mod
your pq )   and send that . 

    however ,   if in my message ,  i take the plaintext  a and
raise it to my  ( secret )  power  y   ,  take the result   ( mod my
pq )  ,  then raise that result to your x    ( mod  your  pq )   and
send this ,  then even after you have normally  " decrypted "  the
message ,   it  will still look like garbage .   however ,  if you
then raise it to my public power x    ,  and take  the  result
 ( mod  my public pq   )  ,  so you will not only recover the ori-
ginal plaintext message ,  but you will know that no one but i
could have sent it to you  ( since no one else knows my secret
y )  . 

     and these are the very concerns by the way that are to-
day tormenting the soviet union about the whole question  of
personal  computers .     on the one hand ,  they recognize that
american schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-
puters  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so ,  in
fact ,  because there are things computers can do  which  will
interest   ( and instruct )  3- and 4-year-olds .   and it is pre-
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
head-to-head against their soviet  counterparts .     for  the
soviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning
ballistics .     on  the  other hand ,  whatever else a personal
computer may be ,  it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50 , 000 words  of
text ,   and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes .   if this
weren't threatening enough ,  the computer that  performs  the
copy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable .   remember that in soviet society  publicly  ac-
cessible  xerox  machines are unknown .     ( the relatively few
copying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-
sively than machine guns are in the united states .  ) 

     now  the   " conservative "  position is that we should not
sell these computers to the soviets ,  because they could  use
them  in weapons systems .   the  " liberal "  position is that we
should sell them ,  in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and
cooperation--and  anyway ,   if  we don't make the sale ,  there
will certainly be some other nation willing to . 

     for my part ,  i'm ready to suggest that the  libertarian
position should be to give them to the soviets for free ,  and
if  necessary ,  make them take them  .   .   .  and if that doesn't
work load up an sr-71  blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over
moscow in the middle of the night .   paid for by private sub-
scription ,  of course ,  not taxation  .   .   .  i confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of  the conventional left-right political spectrum ,  but ,  af-
ter all ,  in the words of one of illuminatus's characters ,  we
are political non-euclideans :    the shortest distance  to  a
particular  goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a  " straight line .  "     taking  a  long  enough
world-view ,   it is arguable that breaking the soviet govern-
ment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to
the enfeeblement and ,  indeed ,  to the ultimate dissolution of
the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at moscow . 

     but  there's  the rub :   a  " long enough "  world view does
suggest that the evil ,  the oppressive ,  the coercive and  the
simply  stupid  will  " get what they deserve ,  "  but what's not
immediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being
killed ,  enslaved ,  or pauperized in the process . 

    when  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-
tack freedom ,  they possessed a reasonably  stable ,   healthy , 
functioning economy ,  and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring   and   dismantle  it .     a  policy  of  political
gradualism was at least  conceivable .     but  now ,   we  have
patchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire
and spit .   the state not only taxes us to   " feed  the  poor " 
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-
crease  yields of milk from the cows left alive .   or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago .   when the price went up ,   we  were  told ,   the  economy
risked  collapse for for want of energy .   the price increase
was called the  " moral equivalent of war "  and the feds  swung
into  action .     for the first time in american history ,  the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-
came an issue of federal concern .    now ,  when the  price  of
oil  drops ,  again we risk problems ,  this time because ameri-
can oil companies and third world  basket-case  nations  who
sell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly over-extended banks .   the suggested panacea is  that
government  should now re-raise the oil prices that opec has
lowered ,  via a new oil tax .   since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  opec  did , 
what  can we call this except the  " moral equivalent of civil
war--the government against its own people ?  " 

     and ,  classically ,  in international trade ,  can you imag-
ine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to
court  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be
compelled by the court to raise its prices ,  but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place ? 

     so  while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we
certainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them .    i contend  that  there
exists  almost  a   " black  hole "   effect in the evolution of
nation-states just as in the evolution of stars .   once free-
dom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent ,   the  state
warps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes
all but impossible .   a good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of so-called  " welfare "  payments .   when those who
sup  at the public trough outnumber  ( and thus outvote )  those
whose taxes must replenish the trough ,   then  what  possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-
ing  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many ?   go
down to the nearest  " welfare "  office ,  find just  two  people
on  the dole  .   .   .  and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question
of who owns your life--and the fruits of your life's labor . 

     so essentially those who love liberty need an  " edge "  of
some  sort  if  we're ultimately going to prevail .   we obvi-
ously  can't  use  the  altruists'   " other-directedness "   of
 " work ,   slave ,  suffer ,  sacrifice ,  so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world .  " 
recognize  that ,  however immoral such an appeal might be ,  it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today's culture . 
if you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a
 " cause ,  "  caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue
working--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy
to draw from .   equally clearly ,  this is just the sort of ap-
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals .   if i were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like ,   " listen ,  follow me as i enunciate my
noble  " cause ,  "  contribute your money to support the  " cause ,  " 
give  up  your  free  time  to  work for the  " cause ,  "  strive
selflessly to bring it about ,  and then  ( after you  and  your
children are dead )  maybe your children's children will actu-
ally  live under egoism " --you'd all think i'd gone mad .   and
of course you'd be right .   because the point i'm  trying  to
make is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if , 
when ,  and as ,  individual libertarians and/or egoists find it
profitable and/or enjoyable to do so .     and  probably  only
then . 

     while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-
tical  action ,  i don't believe that it is the only ,  nor even
necessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing
freedom  in  our time .   consider that ,  for a fraction of the
investment in time ,  money and effort i might expend in  try-
ing  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorship--i can teach every libertarian who's in-
terested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them
unilaterally . 

     there  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to
the eskimoes ,  which very likely most libertarians  have  al-
ready  heard .     and while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying ,  you might well feel that you've heard  it  often
enough already ,  and that it has nothing further to teach us , 
and moreover ,  that maybe you're even tired of hearing it .   i
shall therefore repeat it now : 

     if you give a man a fish ,  the saying runs ,  you feed him
for a day .   but if you teach a man how to fish ,  you feed him
for a lifetime . 

     your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a   " workfare "   vs .    " welfare "   context ;   namely ,  that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need ,  you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance ,  not simply how to  beg  for  it . 
and of course this is true ,  if only because the next time he
is hungry ,  there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish ,  whereas with the information on how
to fish ,  he is completely self sufficient . 

     but  i  submit  that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote ,  and if there were nothing  further  to
glean  from  it ,   i would have wasted your time by citing it
again .   after all ,  it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist
slant ,  as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-
tivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter . 

     but consider : 

     suppose this eskimo doesn't know how to  fish ,   but  he
does  know  how  to hunt walruses .    you ,  on the other hand , 
have often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country
because  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things ,  and
they ate most of the fish you could catch .   and now  suppose
the  two  of  you  decide to exchange information ,  bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge .    well ,   the  first
thing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the marxist  premise
that  every  trade  must  have a  " winner "  and a  " loser ;  "  the
idea that if one person gains ,  it must necessarily be at the
 " expense "  of another person who loses .   clearly ,  under  this
scenario ,  such is not the case .   each party has gained some-
thing  he  did  not have before ,  and neither has been dimin-
ished in any way .   when it comes to exchange of  information
 ( rather  than material objects )  life is no longer a zero-sum
game .   this is an extremely powerful notion .    the   " law  of
diminishing   returns ,  "    the   " first  and  second  laws  of
thermodynamics " --all those  " laws "  which constrain our possi-
bilities in other contexts--no longer bind us !    now  that's
anarchy ! 

     or  consider  another possibility :   suppose this hungry
eskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his
nation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal .    because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones ,  and sometimes sharp spines ,  he
tells us ,  the state has decreed that their  consumption--and
even  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people's
health to be permitted  .   .   .  even by knowledgeable ,   willing
adults .    perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property ,  and therefore it is the  function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-
ment  property .     or perhaps it is because the state gener-
ously extends to competent adults the  " benefits "  it provides
to children and to the mentally ill :   namely ,   a  full-time , 
all-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need
not  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally  " naughty .  "   but ,  in  any
case ,   you  stare stupefied ,  while your eskimo informant re-
lates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of  " pos-
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute .  " 

     now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an
affront to the dignity of all human beings .   you may go far-
ther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-
ary ,  recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant's goal .    ( your rationale may be  " altruistic "   in
the   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed ,   or
 " egoistic "  in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the
oppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-
haps even other motives .  ) 

     but ,  since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to
your  " cause ,  "  you're not about to mount a military campaign , 
or  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade . 
however ,  it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-
formation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold .     i say  " literally ,  "  because for a fraction of
the effort  ( and virtually none of  the  risk )   attendant  to
smuggling in a hundred fish ,  you can quite readily produce a
hundred  xerox copies of fishing instructions .    ( if the tar-
geted government ,  like present-day america ,  at least permits
open  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-
stricted ,   then that should suffice .   but ,  if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as  well ,   then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical eskimo's public-key parameters .   but as far as
increasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine
nonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others
re-disseminate the information you have provided .    and  you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-
eological  adversaries ,  or even trying to win over the unde-
cided .   recall harry browne's dictum  from   " freedom  in  an
unfree world "  that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-
sion is necessary to its fulfilment . 

     if  you  look  at  history ,  you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like  washington , 
lincoln ,    .    .    .   nixon   .    .   .  marcos  .   .   .  duvalier  .   .   . 
khadaffi  .   .   .   and their ilk .   but it has also been  shaped
by  people with names like edison ,  curie ,  marconi ,  tesla and
wozniak .   and this latter shaping has been at least as  per-
vasive ,  and not nearly so bloody . 

     and  that's  where  i'm  trying  to  take the libertech
project .   rather than beseeching the state to please not en-
slave ,  plunder or constrain us ,  i propose a libertarian net-
work spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize
freedom for ourselves . 

     but here we must be a bit careful .   while it is not  ( at
present )   illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government
wants to spy on you ,  there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-
ture  may hold .   there have been bills introduced ,  for exam-
ple ,  which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor
when government wants to shoot you .   that is ,  if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a kevlar vest ,  then that
fact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own . 
this law to my knowledge has not passed  .   .   .  yet  .   .   .   but
it does indicate how government thinks . 

     other  technological  applications ,   however ,  do indeed
pose legal risks .   we recognize ,  for  example ,   that  anyone
who  helped a pre-civil war slave escape on the  " underground
railroad "  was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as
the sovereign government of the united states of america  at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle .   simi-
larly ,  during prohibition ,  anyone who used  his  bathtub  to
ferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug , 
alcohol--the controlled substance ,  wine--was using  technol-
ogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his  " crime " --unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life
when  congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this
drug . 

     so  .   .   .  to quote a former president ,   un-indicted  co-
conspirator  and pardoned felon  .   .   .   " let me make one thing
perfectly clear :  "   the libertech project does not  advocate , 
participate  in ,  or conspire in the violation of any law--no
matter how oppressive ,   unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid
such  law may be .   it does engage in description  ( for educa-
tional and informational  purposes  only )   of  technological
processes ,   and some of these processes  ( like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm )  may well require appropriate li-
censing to perform legally .     fortunately ,   no  license  is
needed  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-
self . 

     so ,  the next time you look at the political  scene  and
despair ,   thinking ,    " well ,   if 51% of the nation and 51% of
this state ,  and 51% of this city have  to  turn  libertarian
before  i'll  be  free ,   then  somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now ,  and put me out of my  misery " --recognize
that  such  is not the case .   there exist ways to make your-
self free . 

     if you wish to explore such techniques via the project , 
you are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake
name  and  mail  drop ,  for that matter--and you'll go on the
mailing list for my erratically-published newsletter .     any
friends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well .   i'm not even asking for stamped  self-
addressed envelopes ,  since my printer can handle mailing la-
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out .    if you
should have an idea to share ,  or even a  useful  product  to
plug ,   i'll be glad to have you write it up for publication . 
even if you want to be the proverbial  " free rider "  and  just
benefit  from  what others contribute--you're still welcome : 
everything will be public domain ;  feel free to  copy  it  or
give it away  ( or sell it ,  for that matter ,  'cause if you can
get  money  for  it while i'm taking full-page ads trying to
give it away ,  you're certainly entitled to  your  capitalist
profit  .   .   .  )   anyway ,  every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer ,  and i'm certainly
willing to underwrite that ,  at least for the forseeable  fu-
ture . 

     i  will leave you with one final thought :   if you don't
learn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they
outlaw  swords ,   then you sure as hell ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too .

from :  rmal@jet . uk  ( richard lucock ) 
subject :  triple des

i have seen various references to 'triple des' recently .  could anyone
tell me what it is  ?  from context ,  i would guess that it means
encrypting each block 3 times ,  with a different key each time ,  but
i'd like to be sure . 

replies by email preferred - our news is unreliable . 

thanks , 
	richard

unfortunately the answer is no - concealing the initialisation vector  
essentially doesn't give any additional security .  i got 3 answers  ( from  
grady@netcom . com ,  mark . lomas@cl . cam . ac . uk ,  smb@research . att . com )  that  
opened my eyes .  it's pretty simple : 

say e is encryption  ( and d decryption )  with key k on 64-bit blocks . 

let c[0] be the initialisation vector , 
m[1] ,  m[2] ,   .  .  .  the message blocks , 
c[1] ,  c[2] ,   .  .  .  the cipher text blocks . 

then encryption in cipher block chaining  ( cbc )  mode works by the formula

   c[i] = e ( m[i] xor c[i-1] )  , 

and decryption by

   m[i] = c[i-1] xor d ( c[i] )  . 

so if the attacker doesn't have c[0] this only affects the first message  
block m[1] .  but she can do her key search attack on m[2] ,  m[3] ,   .  .  . 

the situation in cipher feedback  ( cfb )  mode is a bit more complicated but  
similar and left as an exercise for the reader  : - ) 

finally there is the modified output feedback mode  ( ofb )  where des  ( or  
whatever block cipher you use )  simply acts as random generator by

   s[i] = e ( s[i-1] )  with initialisation vector  ( = seed )  s[0] , 

and encryption is given by

   c[i] = m[i] xor s[i] . 

here the usual `known plaintext' attack against xor-bitstream ciphers  
reduces the cracking to key search for k .

you're reading far too much into this  ( aside from the obvious fact
that you shouldn't hold anybody to what they wrote in a 10 year old
book in a rapidly changing field like this .  ) 


quite simply she says that the security should not depend on the
secrecy of the algorithm .   a secret algorithm can still be secure , 
after all ,  we just don't know it .   only our level of trust is
affected ,  not the security of the system . 

the algorithm *could* be rsa for all we know ,  which we believe to
be secure . 

they have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to
protect its security .   they want to protect its market share . 

if they publish the algorithm ,  then shortly manufacturers would
make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not
use a key stored in escrow .   and of course ,  everybody would buy them . 


the whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that
you can only use if you follow their rules ,  they get us to follow
their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and
nail . 

quite simply ,  with clipper established ,  it would be much harder for
another encryption maker to define a new standard ,  to make phones that
can't talk to the leading phone companies .    the result is tappable
cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds ,  for 99% of the
populace . 


to get untappable crypto ,  you would have to build a special phone that
runs on top of this system ,  and everybody you talk to would have to
have an indentical one . 

that's the chicken and egg of crypto .   the government is using its
very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new
technologies to control this one in a way they like . 


it's almost admirably clever .   when the eff started ,  i posed the question here
 " what are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they
can't wiretap ?  "  and nobody here had an answer  ( or even thought it was
much of a question ) 

then came the backdoor and digital telephony bills ,  which we fought . 

now we have their real answer ,  the cleverest of all .

i do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all .  however , 
using the info they gather while listening ,  they can go searching the right
place and find good ,  strong evidence ,  which they can use in court .  

question  :  currently ,  it is easy to wire-tap ,  from the technical point of
view ,  at least .  anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen
to communications between a car-telephone and the ground station .  the police
also ,  obviously .  the clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the
non-authorized person to eavesdrop  ( note that i do not write << impossible>>  )  . 
the privacy will thus improve from the current situation .  poeple who really
have something to hide already do not use the phone to speak of these things . 
if an illegal operation is really worth ,  one can afford having critical data
carried by a person rather than sending it electronically .  
the clipper chip will not change this .  

the problem is more politic .  foreign countries will never accept the clipper
chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own
police following their own law ,  not the us law .  i . e .  each country will have
its own escrow .  how then will it be possible to monitor the international
traffic ?  or ,  will encrypted international traffic be possible  ?  or will there
be an international escrow ,  some kind of u . n .  thing  ? 

forbidding crypted communication is impractical :  how is it possible to spot
a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate
on the various existing networks .  what about private networks  ?  and this will
be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase
in the next years . 

i think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the
risk of  ,  for instance ,  one's girlfriend's husband listening to his wife's
communications .  it will bring no more as regards to security .  is it worth  ? 
i think so if its cost is limited ,  i think that many privacy invasions are done
not only by official services ,  but also by private entities .  the clipper can
help reducing these .  provided we do not hope too much of it ,  it is not a real
danger and it can be helpful .

  not necessarily .   for instance ,  in the system outlined in the may 1993
issue of  " byte "  ,  the process of getting one's public key listed for general
use involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies ,  which
do calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers of
the public key directory ,  which combines these results into your listed
public key .   if you try to give the escrow agencies pieces which -don't-
yield your private key when they are all put together ,  the result is that
the public key listed for you is wrong and you can't read messages encrypted
to you .

i suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from
offering secure encryption services .   big companies don't take that
kind of risk .   they're too visible and have too much to lose . 

the us government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its
use .   if they could credibly say to ibm or mit :  you will receive no us
government money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on
use of encryption ,  i doubt either organization would delay making use of
encryption a violation of local policies .   the us government gets much of
its power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the
government while putting restrictions on use of such money that would be
illegal if they were enacted as laws .

you are correct  ( several times )  .  tempest is a codeword for a standard ,  shared between the nato governments ,  to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction .  the limits set in the 
standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect 
that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be 
exploited .  it is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic 
field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons . 

among other things ,  i drive a 1987 korean built at clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer .  the major source of unintentional emission is the crt .  to that can be added the video driver card ,  the rs232 parallel cable and the 
printer head .  the emissions from these are gross can be detected with the 
crudest of equipment .  were i to apply good test equipment and some 
intelligence to measuring emission levels ,  i would find many other potential 
sources of leaked information . 

where cryptography is used for serious purposes ,  poor tempest protection 
becomes an important security hazard . 

in the early eighties ,  the need to allow some commercial concerns ,  
particularly financial institutions ,  a level of protection against tempest 
threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the 
'release' of a cut-down tempest stansard for commercial use .  i say 'release' 
for while equipment to meet the standard is available  ( at a price and to 
approved customers )  afaik even the commercial standard remains classified .  if
you think about it ,  it would really have to wouldn't it ?

        i would guess that they won't use clipper at all .   what they will
do is use their stu-iiis amoung themselves and the governmental agencies
they need to talk to ,  and ignore clipper .   after all ,  if it's not secure

evil and good walk hand in hand .   it is also important to note that

i cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic .   technology is neutral
to good or evil .   when technology is used by  " evil "  men ,  it is called
evil technology .   when it is used by  " good "  men ,  it is called good
technology .   really ,  it is just technology that allows action to be
realized more efficently and on a larger scale .

try not to confused the development of technology with its use . 
certainly ,   " bright "  people will be better at creating technology ,  but
even young children know how to program vcr machines .   are vcr
machines not extremely complex to create ?

adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the
stiff and stubborn .   a young child is soft and supple ;  an old man is
stiff and inflexible .   a dripping of water can cut through stone . 
this has nothing to do with technology ,  rather technology just
allows us to magnify action .

these substances are normally not the secret ,  but how to get at them .  the

let's put it this way ,  they have a charter and several executive orders
to obey ,  among other things which *explicitly* prohibit sharing this
information  ( unless things have changed withing the last little while )  . 
i suppose they could ignore it ,  if they choose .   but i doubt they would .

okay ,  folks ,  i know i'm in the minority on this issue ,  but i can't
let this assertion go unchallenged yet again .   i'm going to say this
only once ,  in the hopes of not starting a flame war off of the main
topic . 

guns are offensive .   cryptography is defensive .   see the difference ? 
the only way you can use a gun is to hurt somebody else .   crypto-
graphy helps prevent other people from hurting you . 

sorry for the digression .   let's not forget the issue that we do
agree on :  we want continued access to crypto technology of our
choice ,  without key registration .

anything can be an emissions problem ,  right down to the video cable .   given
the right equipment ,  you can pick the screen paint from the cable .   but , 
given any cable ,  you must know what is being sent through it to know the
format of the signal ,  as well as how many wires ,  etc .

they are using some technology developed by vlsi systems ,  the other manufacturer of
the clipper chips ,  that produces chips that are supposed to be highly resistant to
reverse engineering .

er ,  people are going to make personal attacks on prof .  denning whether she
posts here or not .   that much should be obvious from looking at the traffic
over the last few weeks .   therefore i conclude that the existence of personal
attacks is irrelevant to any decision concerning whether to post . 

i suspect that prof .  denning is actually using the attacks as an excuse for
not posting ,  and that the real reason for the silence is that clipper is not
the sort of proposal any self-respecting cryptographer can support via
reasoned argument .

that's one way to put it .   keeping the algorithm classified means that 
disclosure of it falls under the rubric of  " national security .  "   nothing like 
federal marshalls to guard a monopoly .  .  .

i don't think they can do that without changing the law .   the chip itself
isn't classified ,  and reverse engineering is allowed by law  ( possibly ) 
unless prohibited by a valid contract .   the algorithm may be classified , 
but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information ,  but obtained from unclassified sources ,  is freely
publishable  ( with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information .  )

yes -- great chapter .   elizabeth friedman  ( sp ?  )  comes shining through . 

however ,  the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own
crypto -- hired ex-military folks ,  in fact .    ( how's that for a revolving
door ?  ) 

now ,  given that today's rum runners  ( coke runners ,  actually )  have even more
money than yesterday's ,  it's reasonable to expect them to have even better
cryptography .   i doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet ,  but  .  .  .  . 

so ,  my question of the fbi/nist/nsa is :   " how are you going to make the rum
runners use the clipper chip ?  " 

answer :   	you're not . 

question : 	ok -- in that case ,  your justification for taking away our
		rights has evaporated .   how do you justify our loss of rights
		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists ?

as far as i can see ,  no matter how the session keys are generated  ( be it
diffie-hellman or whatever )  ,  any cripple conversation which travels in
whole or in part over a land-line is vulnerable to this scheme .   law-
enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco ,  or illegally by finding
some part of the phone line that they can cut into .   the degree of risk
depends very much on location - not good in the middle of a busy street , 
but not bad on a line in open country  ( leading to a drug lord's ranch )  .   the
only way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public
key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call  ( all
of them )  - totally impractical ,  even if some part of the cripple algorithm
could be used as a kind of public key  ( i don't understand enough about these
things to know )  . 

this sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link , 
and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for
other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone . 

gosh ,  yet another way to get round cripple encryption .   how many is that
we've found so far ?   and that's without even knowing the details of the
algorithm .

you are correct that executing pgp would be a violation  ( unless the patent
were declared invalid by the courts )  ,  but .  .  .   there is a question as
to when ,  how ,  or if distributing pgp would be a violation .   if the person

clearly a sale  ( for example ,  if it were on compuserve ,  they charge you
for access so they would be selling pgp )  .   when there is no charge for
pgp things get less clear ,  but there would still be a reasonable view
that it is inducing an infringement .

this is a common misconception .   the patent laws do not mention any valid
purpose for infringing a patent .   although it is clear that in order to
create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing
a prior patent ,  one must perform research on an existing patent .   to
just say that you infringed a patent  ( assume we're not talking the rsa
patent )  only for research purposes  ( wink wink ,  nudge nudge )  and then never
develop any related invention  ( ie .  only use it )  ,  would be a clear
infringement .

the same could be said for many other goverment agencies ,  but big budgets , 
large staffs ,  and long lead time haven't made many of them into models of

the fact is that those of us outside the inner circles have only james

wouldn't this method be vulnerable against a  " birthday "  attack ? 
currently a cracker needs to find the _only_  ( *1 )  key that produces
the given ciphertext .   he has to try about 2^63 keys on the average . 
in the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves . 
if he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half ,  he is likely to find
a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses .    ( here i have assumed that the
des-encryption is reversable ,  if the key is guessed .   is this so or do
the modifications of the s-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable ?  ) 

*1 probably there is only one key ;  i think there is 1 chance in about 128
that there are two or more keys  ( can anyone verify this ?  )  ,  but this doesn't
help the cracker much .

i think the obvious answer  ( which may have been posted ,  but i haven't

subject :  advanced one time pad  ( was :  re :  more one time pad stuff ) 


o . k . - if you've read this group for a while ,  you know all about the
one-time-pad ,  but here's a question i haven't seen . 

the one-time-pad yeilds ideal security ,  but has a well-known flaw in
authentication .   suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad ,  and
exclusive-or as the encryption operation .   if an adversary knows the 
plaintext of a message ,  he can change it into any other message .   
here's how it works . 

alice is sending bob a plaintext p ,  under a key stream s
alice computes the ciphertext c = s xor p ,   and sends it to bob . 

eve knows the plainext p ,  but wants the message to appear as p' . 
eve intercepts c ,  and computes  c' = c xor p xor p' = s xor p' . 
eve sends c' to bob . 

bob decrypts c' by computing  c'xor s = p' ,   thus receiving the 
false message which was substituted by eve . 


now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information
theoretic security ,  not just computational security . 
can we define something like  " ideal authentication "  which is the
analog of ideal security .   can we obtain ideal authentication  ? 

if not ,  how much can we limit eve's control over the message  ? 

if we can achieve ideal authentication ,  does the solution use more
key bits or expand the message  ?   can we show the solution to be
optimal in one or more parameters  ? 

does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before  ?

subject :  one-time pad authentication ? 

   i can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time
pad encrytped scheme ,  though i'm not sure how to prove that what kind of
authenicity they provide . 
 
   an obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random  ( unpredictable
for eve )  block to the message ,  and then calculate a crc which included the
random starting block and all of the message .   this could be encrypted after
the message .   the problem is ,  i'm not sure it's impossible to come up with
a message that will hash to the same crc regardless of the random starting
block .    ( it intuitively seems like it ought to be hard ,  but i'm not *that*
sure .  .  .  .  )   clearly ,  a crypto-strength hash like md5 or the sha would be
stronger ,  but again ,  i'm not sure i'm comfortable claiming that it's
unbreakable . 
 
   a scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's
to include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad , 
either .   at the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your
pad ,  this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your
opponent could spoof a valid-looking message ,  since any deciphered plaintext
in a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going
on . 
 
   if ,  for each message bit m_i ,  we used up one random bit ,  r_i ,  to decide
whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream ,  we'd get a total pad use
of 2 . 5 times the message length .    ( we'd expand the message size by about
half .  )   each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a
guess for our would-be spoofer .   at each bit ,  she has to guess .   i'm trying
to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the
spoofed message ,  but it gets a little complicated ,  because she can get un-
synched ,  and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message . 
 
   now ,  i can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure
as a one-time pad ,  at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits . 
 
   for each message bit ,  m_i ,  use one random bit ,  r_i ,  and xor them together
to get x_i .   now ,  encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad .   the enemy
has no way of guessing what r_i is ,  so he/she can't guess what x_i is ,  either . 
any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess
of what r_i was .   is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits ? 
 
   spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random
bits as there are bits in the message .   clearly ,  this makes spoofing messages
just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it . 
in fact ,  it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed
message with the ciphertext as without it ,  but i'm not entirely sure about
that . 
 
   is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the
one-time pad ?

firstly ,  an aside : 

i agree that the weakness exists ,  but i have a lot of trouble
believing that it represents a difficulty in real life .  given : 

1 .  the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security , 
and the expense of key distribution etc .  ,  imply that the clients
really do want that level of security

2 .  these same people want to keep p a secret

i find it hard to believe that eve might happen to have a copy of p
lying around . 

 ( i am aware that the same argument applies to eve knowing even a small
part of the message ,  but eve must know exactly where  ( which bytes )  in
c her known susequence starts ,  or the result will be garbled .  i find
this at least as surprising .  ) 

back to the question : 

if i had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions ,  i
would also append a message authentication code to the message ,  using up
the next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps .  your original
question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the
message with the same degree of security as the pad itself provided , 
and i don't know the answer .  however ,  i would propose the following
for discussion . 

alice and bob have an arbitrary number of secret ,  random bits to
share ,  which eve doesn't know .  she finds them out  ( effectively )  by
knowing some p and the corresponding c .  it is the fact that they
correspond that causes the problem .  if a message authentication code was to
be created using some one-time-pad operation such that eve could not
know which parts of the mac were affected by which parts of the input , 
she would be unable to forge a mac to correspond . 

what is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message . 
 ( non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't
have exactly the same effect )  . 

now ,  at the end of the encrypted message c ,  alice appends a n-bit mac
computed as follows  ( s2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad )  : 
  1 .  compute c2 = p xor s2 ,  and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of s
  2 .  break c2 into n-bit chunks
  3 .  set mac to 0  ( initialisation vector ) 
  4 .  for i in each chunk sequentially
       set mac = mac nlop c2[i]

at the end of this process mac is the message authentication code . 

 ( bob verifies the mac in the obvious manner ;  he recovers the
plaintext p ,  then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the mac in
the same manner .  ) 

nlop is the non-linear operator ,  and there is the rub .  the simplest
non-linear operator i can think of is an s-box ;  that is ,  have a fixed
 ( even published )  permutation of the n-bit integers ,  an indexable table
called sbox ,  and use : 
  x nlop y = x xor sbox[y] . 

practically speaking ,  i think this solves your problem ,  as eve never
sees the intermediate output c2 ,  and hence can't deduce s2 or perform any valid
substitution on it . 

also practically speaking ,  you want the mac to be fairly large ,  say 32
bits ,  but you might not want a 4 gigabyte  ( say )  s-box ,  so you might
work on 4 byte-sized s-boxes ,  but i think that is an irrelevant detail
for the discussion at hand . 

who will be first to point out my errors ,  or give me a pointer to some
literature ?
