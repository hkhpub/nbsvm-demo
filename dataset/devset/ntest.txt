subject :  for sale :  urei 527a 27-band equalizer

i have a urei 527a 27-band  ( mono )  equilizer for sale .   anyone who knows
this unit knows it's been a recording studio standard for years .   it's a
pretty straightforward unit ,  with balanced ins and outs .   power supply caps
were recently replaced ,  and i added xlr connectors  ( which can be easily
removed if you prefer ,  as i mounted them on a bracket outside the case )  .  
the unit is in good shape ,  and is sonically very clean . 

i'm asking $225 + ups shipping .   they're going for $250 generally .   make me
an offer .

    correction :  i check the diskettes ,  it only contains the pc/tcp
     kernel ,  no applications .  it is only good for people who needs
     to run their own lan applications that uses ftp pc/tcp kernel
     calls ,  but mot the extra telnet/ftp/ etc .  .  .  applications .

i recently purchased an ibm monochrome vga monitor from mike damico .  the
monitor arrived but it was missing it's power cable .  mike's address is
apparently not a proper address because mail can't reach it .  if anyone
knows how to contact mike and could help me find him i would appreciate it . 
i am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor
but it would be a lot more useful to me if i had the cord as well .

subject :  for sale :  altos 2000 unix machine

i have an altos 2000 system v . 3 unix system for sale  ( i actually have two , 
but one's for me )  .  several years ago these well-known machines sold for
$30 , 000 for the base configuration .  this particular one has much more than the
base configuration ,  depending on what you want : 

- 386 16 mhz cpu . 
- 8 meg of ram . 
- fifteen  ( 15 )  serial ports  ( or more if you want )  ! 
- a multidrop port for up to 256 more serial ports ! 
- ethernet . 
- 5 . 25 "  floppy drive . 
- qic 24 cartridge tape drive . 
- 170 meg esdi hard drive  ( either micropolis or cdc ,  or both if you want )  . 
- unix system v . 3 installation . 
- networking software package  ( tcp/ip )  . 
- development system software package  ( c compiler and libraries )  . 

i am asking only $700  ( firm )  for the system !  if you want another ethernet or
serial card ,  add $50 .  additional disks are $100 each  ( i can install a total of
three esdi drives )  .  i would consider a trade for a scsi dat tape drive . 

this box would make a great bbs system or terminal server .  it was originally
designed to service 40 active users ,  and up to 70 moderately active users . 
this is not a pc !  it was designed to be a unix box from the start ,  and it's
very fast and exceptionally reliable . 

it's dimensions are approximately 2 . 5' high  ( tower )  ,  8 "  wide and 2 "  deep . 

i am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up . 
shipping is way too much hassle .  call if you wish ,  or send email .

subject :  physically sound lp records 4 sale ,  trade or barter


i still have about 70 records left on hand ,  all in pristine condition
 ( except where noted )  ,  quite a few out-of-print and more than a few
imports in the bunch . 

rather than selling the majority for $3-4 each ,  i'm looking to barter
packages for stuff that you might be selling over usenet .   i'll also
trade for other records in very good condition that you've replaced
with cd ,  as well as pre-recorded videos on beta or vhs .   in the past , 
i've been able to make deals based on the equivalent list/store price
 ( e . g .  ,  1 cd = 1 movie in beta format* )  to get around what you or i
might have originally paid  ( as if we can even remember !    ( - ;  )  **

[at this time ,  i'm looking for a set of working aa nicad rechargable
batteries  .  .  .  if you have some lying around ,  and they're sound ,  rsvp ! ]

so if you're curious ,  rsvp for my list and if you see anything that
you like ,  send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of
your ad for the stuff you're selling  .  .  .  thanks ! 

gld

* i . e .  ,  the imports and out-of-prints are also valued at 1 used cd ; 

** i once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records  ( list $81 )  ; 
anybody got a nice ,  unused blender for making frozen margaritas ?   ( - ; 

ps :  there have been no additions since the last posting in february ; 
        the list has only shrunk as i've made a few deals since .

----
rabbit pip  ( picture-in-picture )  box . 

this device when used with a vcr tuner will allow you to

the you can press swap on the remote and the small picture
will be swapped with the main picture . 

the only limitation to this box is that it is has 36 channel
tuner .  this means that the box itself cannot tune higher
than cable channel 36 .  however ,  if your vcr tuner is capable
of tuning higher than this ,  then you simply tune the vcr to the
channel desired and then swap pictures  ( assuming the alternate
picture is channel 36 or lower )  and it will work fine . 

original cost :  $149
will sell for :   $75


----

of these records ,  once ,  maybe twice if i didn't record the song i
wanted correctly the first time .   these records are in perfect
condition .   please email me with the records you would want and what
you think a fair price is .   i will probably give deals ,  the more
records you buy .   kinda capatalist isn't it .   well give me a yell at

						see ya

	i have recieved a few questions as to what 12 "  are .   i guess i
should elaborate .    (  ?  ?  ?  !  !  !  !  am i that old ?  )   they are just
maxi-singles on wax .   if i am correct most beat mixers still use this
form of record .   this is probably the kind of person interested in
this colllect or parts of it .  any questions call  ( 515 )  294-3737 .

items for sale .  .  .  .  . 

this package was bought throught a award give-away company .  i attempted
to cancel my order before i received the package ,  but i was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund .  i know the truth
which i would never get my $697 back ,  but i wish to get my money back as
close as possible .  here is the describtion of the package .  .  . 

nishika 3d camera	it takes very good picture ,  never been opended
			or used .  it came with wide angle flesh ,  carring
			case ,  film ,  and a instruction video .  it has four
			lens and created a 3d effect on a regular 35mm
			film . 

jewelry			it came with the package as additional gift . 

bahama vacation voucher	the voucher is good for two rt airfare to freeport . 
			the users get a special hotel rate of $27 per-person
			per-night .  meals ,  ground transfer ,  hotel tax is
			_not_ included . 

las vegas ,  reno ,  orlando	the voucher provides one rt airfare ,  and
				hotel accomodation for 3 days/ 2 nights . 
				meals ,  ground transfer ,  hotel tax is not
				included .  the voucher is good for all 3
				locations ,  but you can't travel to all 3
				places at once . 

cancun ,  mexico		the voucher provides one rt airfare ,  and hotel
			accomodation for 3 days / 2 nights .  meals and
			ground transfer ,  hotel tax is not included as
			usual . 

i paid $697 for the whole package .  so try not to be cold-blooded when you
make your offer .  details would be provided by request .  i do wish to sell
the whole package at once .  so if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers ,  i don't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
if you are interested in the camera ,  you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift . 

if you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards .  
trust me ,  you would get the exactly the same package as i did .  there is 
only one award which will be given away .  so don't bother even to call them 
back ,  if you are really interested ,  you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price .  and you could receive the package within a week  (  i waited three 
months to get my first and final packages )  .  also ,  they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company .  so why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price . 

if you are interested ,  please reply to me as soon as posible .  i really
wish to get this over with .  make me an offer ,  if i am confortable with
your offer ,  i would send the package by u . p . s .  the next day morning . 
more details could be given if you wish .

computer equipment garage sale : 

i've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff
that is broken or not being used by me .   i've put together a list and
indicated what i think each item is worth .   this is just my estimate ,  and i
am very open to any offers ,  including trades .   i'm currently looking for
some cd-roms that will work with a mac cd rom player cd caddies ,  hd floppy 
disks ,  any used macintosh software ,  a 387-33mhz co-processor ,  or basically 
anything you have lying around  ( cans of soup ,  the neighbor's cat ,  etc .  .  .  )   
make me an offer ,  no offer will be overlooked .  .  .  
i really want to get rid of this stuff .  .  . 

ok ,  here's the list : 

52 meg 3 . 5 "  scsi hard drive .   conner model #cp-3150 .   i bought this from a guy
	at a swap meet to use with my macintosh .   unfortunately ,  i can't seem 
	to get it to work with the scsi controller in my computer .   the
	guy tested it with his pc ,  and printed out a copy of the norton disk 
	doctor report which says it has no bad sectors .   ( i'll send you a copy )  
	i was dumb enough not to get his phone number ,  so i can't return it to 
	him .  the drive has many jumpers on it ,   ( which i don't know how to set )  
	so maybe that's the problem .   i was quite disappointed that it didn't
	work so i'm trying to minimize my losses . 	~$45

52 meg 3 . 5 "  scsi hard drive .  conner model #cp-3150 .   same situation as above . 
	i bought both of these drives from the same guy .   despite the different
	model numbers they are the same exact drive .   same report from ndd
	 ( i have one for each drive )  will be included . 	~$45

40 meg sony 3 . 5 "  scsi hard drive .   sony model #srd2040a .   the drive mechanism 
	is completely trashed .   this hard drive was in my computer  ( mac se )  and
	had a stiction problem .   well ,  repeated banging on the side of the
	computer resulted in a head crash  ( yes ,  metal scraping metal )  which
	was not too pleasant to listen to .   still the scsi controller
	card is in good working order ,  and can be used for parts ,  or a 
	project . 	~$20

65 meg seagate 5 . 25 "  hh scsi hard drive .   model #st-277n .   i originally bought
	this drive ,  because it had a small stiction problem ,  and i though that
	i could fix it .   well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine , 
	and that it was a controller problem .    ( motor controller wasn't sending
	proper signals .  )   well ,  after taking the controller off the drive ,  
	looking at it ,  and putting it back together ,  i realized that i
	accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 
	drive to the controller .   i tried to solder it ,  but i'm not that good
	at soldering so i couldn't do it .   worked perfectly before i messed
	up .   i used it as a temporary drive when the sony  ( above )  crashed on
	me .   also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications , 
	worth well over $1000 .    ( claris cad ,  ms word 5 . 0 ,  think c , 
	excel ,  and many others )  
	i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable .   you also get all
	the software on the drive .   ( if you can accept being a pirate )   i only 
	ask that you delete my data files from the drive .   i was really angry
	when i broke that connection ,  and then couldn't fix it .   i just don't 
	have time to play with it any more . 	~$65

at&t isdn 7500 modem .   this is for use on digital phone systems .   if you know
	what this is or would like technical information on it ,  let me know .   i
	have some tech documents on it .   is supposed to be the same thing as an
	at&t digital phone ,  but without the phone part .   it seems to be in  
	working order  ( passes self test perfectly ok )  .   i have no idea how 
	this is worth .  .  .    let me know if you're interested . 

motorola 68881 coprocessor .   i haven't tested this one out yet ,  but if anyone 
	is interested i will get it tested out ,  to make sure that it works .   i
	had trouble using it with my accelerator board ,  but then i spoke to the
	manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn't be used without 
	another controller chip .   when i was looking around to buy one new ,  the
	prices were around $100 .   i will guarantee this to work . 	~$65

cga card .   half-length .  8-bit .   wasn't working last time i checked  ( although
	i think i was using a bad monitor ) 	~$5

5 . 25 " 	360k floppy drive .   ibm drive type 1355 .   guaranteed to work ,  
	because when i took it out of the pc ,  it was working ! 		~$25

5 . 25 "  360k floppy drive .   toshiba model number nd-08de-a .   guaranteed to 
	work .   came out of same pc as above . 	~$25

5 . 25 " 	floppy drives .   can't guarantee that these will work .   i don't
	even know if they are low or high density drives .   i don't have
	any method of testing them . 
		panasonic model number :  ju-455-5 acg .   there's another
			number on it :  2626-361723 . 
		panasonic model number :  ju-475-2 agg .   there's also
			another number on it :  h3649-101457
		toshiba model number nd-08de .   virtually identical to the one 
			above . 
	each drive ~$10

3 . 5 "  ps/2 drive .   these things are proprietary ,  so i can't test it ,  but i
	think it works .   not sure if it's high density or low density ,  but i
	suppose someone who is looking for one would know .   model number
	dfl413c04a .   i think these things are expensive to replace .   ~$35

mfm hard drive controller cards .   i've got three of these ,  and i have no way
	of testing them .   two of them are 8-bit cards ,  and one is a sixteen bit
	card with a floppy controller built in . 	~$10 for the 8-bits ~$15 for
	the 16-bit card w/floppy . 

interesting cable .   seems to convert from a vga plug to an ega plug .   that is , 
	standard nine-pin to vga 15 pin .  made by hewlett packard .   part no . 
	d1181-80020		~$10



i've sold stuff like this before ,  and it was a huge success ,  with many 
satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn't need anymore .   i 
usually ship through the u . s .  postal service  ( haven't had any problems yet )  
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated . 

well ,  that's all folks .   as i said before ,  no offer will be refused .   if you 
can convince me to give ocit to you instead of throwing it out ,  try !   i hate
to throw away stuff .  .  .

i have had a nikon l35aw since 1988 .  unfortunately it is no longer
made .  it is a p & s sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet .  it
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions .  it takes aa batteries  ( hooray )  .  it has the solid , 
heavy feel of old-style nikons and has taken all the abuse i have
been able to give it .  this includes a lot of water  ( rain ,  river and
sea )  ,  desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger .  shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
didn't scare the mugger away ,  hitting him with the flying camera
did .  this is my ,   " never be without a camera "  camera .  the current
water-resistant  ( sport touch i think is the name )  model is nothing
like as solid or well sealed .

subject :  hot shots '93  ( adult )  cards for sale



recently i got a case of hot shots '93 cards .   unfortunately i had
not planned on keeping all of them .   i sort of got stuck with the
case .    ( i'm not going to mention any names ,  though .  ) 

so ,  i am trying to sell off most or all  ( minus a set for myself )  . 

if you have any interest in a set ,  a box ,  or any singles ,  please let
me know . 

the set has 250 cards .   each card features a great looking woman in
various stages of dress .   some nude ,  semi-nude ,  lingerie ,  dressed . 
99 percent are gorgeous ,  i feel . 

there are 4 subsets : 

girl ,  girl ,  girls   1 through 9
promo cards   251 through 259  ( also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9 ) 
emperor's all-stars   269 through 277
stripping empress   260 through 268

also ,  i am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well . 

oh ,  and lastly ,  i have a very few error cards and a few cards
that were originally intended to be used as card #1 ,  but the
company changed their mind .   none of these cards are easy to get . 

anyway ,  if you have some interest in any of these cards ,  please
drop me a line ,  as i am most eager to sell a bunch off . 

oh ,  and if you are interested ,  i also have 1 set of hot shots '92
left ,  and about 2 sets of california dreaming cards as well . 

and lastly ,  i have promo cards for all of the cards i have
mentioned ,  and holograms as well .   not a lot ,  though .

subject :  for sale :  386/25mhz motherboard  ( or system )  with 8 megabytes

i recently upgraded to a 486 and have found out i don't really have a need
for my old 386 .   i'd prefer to sell just the motherboard and keep the case
etc ,  so i'll offer the motherboard and case separately and let you decide . 

i'm asking $325 for the motherboard ,  which has : 
    25mhz 386 dx  ( not sx ) 
    8 megabytes of 32-bit ,  70ns memory
    ami bios
    based on c&t neat chipset
    	 ( this means the motherboard and bus circuitry timings are
	programmable - the bios' advanced configuration menus let you
	select system ,  dma ,  bus clock ,  wait states ,  command delays ,  etc .  ) 
     " baby at "  sized - fits in mini-tower ,  full-sized or most any other case
 ( includes user's guide and a copy of the bios reference manual ) 

for $150 more you could have the rest of the system too : 
    full-size at case with 200 (  ?  )  watt power supply
    2 serial ,  1 parallel ,  1 game ports
    20mb hard disk
    1 . 2mb floppy disk
    keyboard
    video card  ( choice of vga or  ?  ?  ?  ) 

if you're interested ,  please give me a call .   the system is set up at my house
in aloha ,  and you're welcome to come test drive it .

subject :  tapes and serial cables

it's basement cleaning time .   this stuff has got to go . 

i have two boxes of 9 track 2400' tapes ,  around 20 tapes/box .   they are
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up .   they've seen
very little use .   if anyone wants these bad enough to ship ,  they're yours
for the cost of shipping ,  the cod charge and a $10 nusiance fee . 

i have a lot of serial cables .   i have all kinds ,  ribbon ,  shielded ,  long , 
short m-m ,  m-f whatever you want .   most appear to work well with pc serial
ports ,  but i will not gaurantee that .   tell me what you want and i'll do
the best i can to match .   1 . 50 ea or 10/$10 .   shipping included .   no cods
under $20 .    ( you want to pay a $5 cod charge for a $1 . 50 cable ?   go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead ,  it'll be cheaper .  )   i believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center .   they appear
to be in good condition and the ones i have used have worked well . 

i also have a 15 kva exide ups with batteries that needs minor repair ,  probably
a logic board .   it weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high .   i think
they used to run a prime system off of it .   best offer over $75 ,  but you 
need to come pick it up .   use this to run your house from your solar panels . 

i will consider reasonable offers on any of this stuff .

subject :  wanted-old 70's record


 i'm looking for an old album or cassette tape .  the group is sanford/townsend
the name of the album is 'smoke from a distant fire'  ( i think )  .  this album
came out somewhere around  1975-76 ,  and i believe was the first album produced
by kenny loggins after he and jim messina broke up . 

if you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it ,  great .  if
you don't want to part with it ,  but are willing to copy it onto cassette i'd
love that too . 

thanks

subject :  3 high-end car amplifiers for sale


/* posted for a friend -- please reply to him */

++++++++++++++++++++++++ car amplifiers for sale +++++++++++++++++++++++++

i have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale : 

 ( 2 )  old-style rockford fosgate 150's .   these are great amps ,  and i've never
    had a minute's trouble with either of them .   i've been running them on
    high end for quite some time  ( front/rear )  and have been very pleased
    with them in that setup ,  but i've also run them on low end before ,  and
    they perform quite well in that situation as well .   i'm trying to sell
    them because i'm considering upgrading to a rockford 650 .   i already
    own a power 300 ,  and i've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked
    in cars . 

    i'm asking $200 . 00 a piece ,  and list on them when i bought them was
    $375 . 00 .   if you're interested in both of them ,  i'd be willing to come
    down on the price a little bit . 


 ( 1 )  precision power 2150 .   this great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150 , 
    and looks brand new .   the shroud is unscratched ,  and it works great . 
    this is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into
    2 channels ,  however ,  i've also had it running front or back high end
    before where it did very well . 

    i'm asking $425 . 00 for this amp ,  but feel free to make me an offer on
    it .

from :  craigv@rad . verbex . com
subject :  ensoniq sq-80 cross-wave synthesizer for sale


ensoniq sq-80 cross-wave synthesizer : 
i have an sq-80 for sale .   the sq-80 is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer .   i bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire ;   it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more  " digital "  . 
below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual : 
  o eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer ,  capable of
    playing eight different sounds at once ,  with dynamic stereo
    panning for each voice
  o voice section employing cross-wave synthesis ;   combine different
    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex ,  dynamic sounds
  o 75 sampled waves  ( includes a drumset )  serve as the sound source
  o dynamic voice allocation :   each sequencer track/midi channel has
    access to all eight voices
  o a full-featured midi controller keyboard capable of sending eight
    midi program and volume changes at once .   keyboard is velocity
    sensitive ,  and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch . 
  o powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
    modulation sources and routings . 
  o a 3 . 5 "  floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary ds/dd disks
    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to
    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk .   also has a ram-cart slot
    for patches that is compatible with esq-1 ram-carts . 
  o does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable midi device
  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly  " page-driven " 
    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
  o stereo line-outs ,  and stereo headphone jack for private listening
  o sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the esq-1
    so that sounds and sequences created for the esq-1 can be played on
    the sq-80 . 

this sq-80 has been the main midi controller in my studio for quite a while
now .   it has performed ably in that role ,  and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time .   the sq-80 seems to have been designed
with this role in mind ,  and it works very well with my software sequencer
 ( wincake )  in its multitimbral mode . 

>from a synthesis point of view ,  this machine is a hybrid .   it uses looped
short samples  ( there are 75 of them )  as sources ,  then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated dcf-dca arrangement .   the sq-80
is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter . 
simply put ,  it makes fabulous analog synth sounds .   but unlike most
good analog synths ,  it has a very thorough midi implementation so that it
works very well with a midi sequencer .   what i really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds . 
this sq-80 is about 5 years old  ( mfg .  date 1/21/88 )  .   it does have
an 8-track sequencer ,  but like most on-board sequencers ,  it is a pain
to use so i have avoided it . 

reason for sale : 
i am selling my sq-80 because i recently joined forces with another individual
here in boston ,  and we have more keyboards than space to put them .   i
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard . 

pricing and terms : 
i paid $1300 . 00 for this synth a few years ago .   i am willing to accept
$650 . 00  ( average r . m . m . s asking price is $733 . 00 )  .   i will include a bunch of 
patches on sq-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth ,  as well as the 
original ensoniq sq-80 owner's manual . 

price :     asking $650 . 00  ( everything ) 
shipping :  split shipping  ( ups surface cod )  anywhere in the lower 48 states

he is a crook .   don't deal with him !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! 

please help : 

i am looking for dana weick .   a month ago i made a deal with him over the
net .   i was to sell him some memory ,  in exchang for $100 and a 486-66 cpu . 
i thought the deal was great ,  so i went on with it .   

i sent him the memory cod for $100 .   he was then suppose to send me the cpu . 
i receive his cod payment on 4/8/93 .   he send me a message the he sent the
cpu out 4/16/93 .   it has been two weeks ,  and i didn't receive the cpu . 

i send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship ,  or
what address he send it to  ( to make sure it didn't get lost in the mail .  ) 
he never reply my mail .   

i finally resorted to calling him in arizona .   the first call didn't get
throught ,  i got  an answering machine .   i left him my number .   he didn't reply . 
i call again the next day and he pick up the phone .   i asked him if he had
send out the cpu .   he said yes ,  but he doesn't know what address he sent it
to .   

he said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day . 
to my suprise ,  he never called .   i then send him some more email messages ,  he
never reply again .   ( strang ,  when the deal was being made ,  he reply to every
of my message ,  now that he got my memory ,  he won't even reply to me .  ) 

now :   i am still calling him ,  but he won't pick up the phone .   i am also still
      emailing him ,  but he won't reply my mail . 

so if any one know this dana weick ,  please contact him .

great ,  you can send the simms to me at : 
dana weick
4238 w las palmaritas
phoenix ,  az  85051
 ( 602 )  925-6123  ( days )   ( 602 )  842-2145  ( evenings ) 

i would prefer us mail ,  2nd day priority  ( it only costs $2 . 90 ) 

the cpu is brand new ,  install it correctly  ( meaning don't plug it in
backwards or bend any pins )  and i'll warranty it for 6 months . 
thanks

****on 4/8 i send him and said .  .  . 
that i got the cod payment . 
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
>is the cpu sent out yet ? 
****he replied .  .  .  .  . on 4/9

glad the cod payment got to you ok ,  the cpu has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it .   be *very* careful when you install it ,  be careful of static discharge , 
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation .   the chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards i won't be real
sympathetic !  
 
if you don't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed ,  
don't guess ! 


********************************dana weick update : ****************************

i call him sunday ,  his wife debbie picked up the phone .   she said that he was 
busy with his kids ,  and he would call me back in 10 minuets .   half an house
went by ,  weick didn't called .   i called him again ,  and his phone was discon-
nected . 

since this post ,   i have numberous people who mail me saying that this dana
weick have ripped them off .   we got do something about this guy .   he has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now .   and he is getting away
with it .

      agreed .   i have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net
      and i have bought things from cds  ( plenty !  )  to a full computer . 
      the only small problem that i have had was with ups rather than
      the seller .   besides ,  complaints are always what get the
      publicity .  .  .  . when something goes wrong ,  people complain .   rarely
      have i seen posts stating how well a deal went through .   i guess
      kevin is practically a first !

          what you can do is contact the local authorities in arizona 
where this scammer resides ,  inform them of the situation  ( if you have 
proof of the transaction ,  that would also help )  ,  and they should be able 
to take it from there . 
 
        yeah ,  this guy can get heavily penalized for this .   don't think

subject :  electronic music software - winsong for windows - like new $70


i just received a music software winsong for windows and found that it needs
a midi/sound card  ( sound blaster pro is preferred )  to have its fantastic
features show up .  as i don't have the plan to add a sound card now ,  i am 
putting it here for sale .  it's listed $79 . 95 on april issue of windows 
magazine and i paid $84 . 95 as the total .  i am asking around $70 with shipping
included . 

winsong for windows : 

composer ,  sequencer  ( tape deck )  ,  and juke box all in one . 

it's a word processor for music - you can write and edit  ( cut ,  paste ,  move
and copy ,  etc )  notes and symbols ,  play and print your composition . 

it's graphical user interface works like a multi-track tape recorder . 
up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play ,  record ,  rewind ,  fast-forward
and stop . 

it plays music on any midi compatible instrument - piano ,  guitar ,  drum set , 
saxophone ,  clarinet ,  organ ,  and many . 

you do not need to be a musician to use this software .  the on-line manual
is handy .  for musicians ,  it's great as writing music is not a tedious and
stifling aspect . 

almost new  ( one week old )  ,  unregistered
$70  ( including shipping )  obo  ( please be reasonable )
